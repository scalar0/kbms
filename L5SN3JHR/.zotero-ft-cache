Department of Civil Engineering University of Waterloo Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3GI
Aims and Scope of the Series
The fundamental questions arising in mechanics are: Why?, How?, and How much? The aim of this series is to provide lucid accounts written by authoritative researchers giving vision and insight in answering these questions on the subject of mechanics as it relates to solids.
The scope of the series covers the entire spectrum of solid mechanics. Thus it includes the foundation of mechanics; variational formulations; computational mechanics; statics, kinematics and dynamics of rigid and elastic bodies: vibrations of solids and structures; dynamical systems and chaos; the theories of elasticity, plasticity and viscoelasticity; composite materials; rods, beams, shells and membranes; structural control and stability; soils, rocks and geomechanics; fracture; tribology; experimental mechanics; biomechanics and machine design.
The median level of presentation is the first year graduate student. Some texts are monographs defining the current state of the field; others are accessible to final year undergraduates; but essentially the emphasis is on readability and clarity.

Preface
Engineered structures are almost as old as human civilization and undoubtedly began with rudimentary tools and the first dwellings outside caves. Great progress has been made over thousands of years, and our world is now filled with engineered struc
from fragile human-powered aircraft to sleek jets and thundering rockets are, in our opinion, among the most challenging and creative examples of these efforts. The study of mechanics and structural analysis has been an important area of engineering over the past 300 years, and some of the greatest minds have contributed to its development. Newton formulated the most basic principles of equilibrium in the 17th century, but fundamental contributions have continued well into the 20th century. Today, structural analysis is generally considered to be a mature field with well-established principles and practical tools for analysis and design. A key reason for this is, without doubt, the emergence of the finite element method and its widespread application in all areas of structural engineering. As a result, much of today’s emphasis in the field is no longer on structural analysis, but instead is on the use of new materials and design synthesis. The field of aerospace structural analysis began with the first attempts to build flying machines, but even today, it is a much smaller and narrower field treated in far fewer textbooks as compared to the fields of structural analysis in civil and mechanical engineering. Engineering students have access to several excellent texts such as those by Donaldson [1] and Megson [2], but many other notable textbooks are now out of print. This textbook has emerged over the past two decades from our efforts to teach
in aerospace engineering. By the time students enroll in the undergraduate course, they have studied statics and covered introductory mechanics of deformable bodies dealing primarily with beam bending. These introductory courses are taught using texts devoted largely to applications in civil and mechanical engineering, leaving our students with little appreciation for some of the unique and challenging features of aerospace structures, which often involve thin-walled structures made of fiberreinforced composite materials. In addition, while in widespread use in industry and

VIII Preface
the subject of numerous specialized textbooks, the finite element method is only slowly finding its way into general structural analysis texts as older applied methods and special analysis techniques are phased out. The book is divided into four parts. The first part deals with basic tools and concepts that provide the foundation for the other three parts. It begins with an introduction to the equations of linear elasticity, which underlie all of structural analysis. A second chapter presents the constitutive laws for homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic material but also includes an introduction to anisotropic materials and particularly to transversely isotropic materials that are typical of layered composites. The first part concludes with chapter 4, which defines isostatic and hyperstatic problems and introduces the fundamental solution procedures of structural analysis: the displacement method and the force method. Part 2 develops Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with emphasis on the treatment of beams presenting general cross-sectional configurations. Torsion of circular crosssections is discussed next, along with Saint-Venant torsion theory for bars of arbitrary shape. A lengthy chapter is devoted to thin-walled beams typical of those used in aerospace structures. Coupled bending-twisting and nonuniform torsion problems are also addressed. Part 3 introduces the two fundamental principles of virtual work that are the basis for the powerful and versatile energy methods. They provide tools to treat more realistic and complex problems in an efficient manner. A key topic in Part 3 is the development of methods to obtain approximate solution for complex problems. First, the Rayleigh-Ritz method is introduced in a cursory manner; next, applications of the weak statement of equilibrium and of energy principles are presented in a more formal manner; finally, the finite element method applied to trusses and beams is presented. Part 3 concludes with a formal introduction of variational methods and general statements of the energy principles introduced earlier in more applied contexts. Part 4 covers a selection of advanced topics of particular relevance to aerospace structural analysis. These include introductions to plasticity and thermal stresses, buckling of beams, shear deformations in beams and Kirchhoff plate theory. In our experience, engineering students generally grasp concepts more quickly when presented first with practical examples, which then lead to broader generalizations. Consequently, most concepts are first introduced by means of simple examples; more formal and abstract statements are presented later, when the student has a better grasp of the significance of the concepts. Furthermore, each chapter provides numerous examples to demonstrate the application of the theory to practical problems. Some of the examples are re-examined in successive chapters to illustrate alternative or more versatile solution methods. Step-by-step descriptions of important solution procedures are provided. As often as possible, the analysis of structural problems is approached in a unified manner. First, kinematic assumptions are presented that describe the structure’s displacement field in an approximate manner; next, the strain field is evaluated based on the strain-displacement relationships; finally, the constitutive laws lead to the stress field for which equilibrium equations are then established. In our experience, this ap

proach reduces the confusion that students often face when presented with developments that don’t seem to follow any obvious direction or strategy but yet, inevitably lead to the expected solution. The topics covered in parts 1 and 2 along with chapters 9 and 10 from part 3 form the basis for a four semester-hour course in advanced aerospace structural analysis taught to junior and senior undergraduate students. An introductory graduate level course covers part 2 and selected chapters in parts 3 and 4, but only after a brief review of the material in part 1. A second graduate level course focusing on variational end energy methods covers part 3 and selected chapters in part 4. A number of homework problems are included throughout these chapters. Some are straightforward applications of simple concepts, others are small projects that require the use of computers and mathematical software, and others involve conceptual questions that are more appropriate for quizzes and exams. A thorough study of differential calculus including a basic treatment of ordinary and partial differential equations is a prerequisite. Additional topics from linear algebra and differential geometry are needed, and these are reviewed in an appendix. Notation is a challenging issue in structural analysis. Given the limitations of the Latin and Greek alphabets, the same symbols are sometimes used for different purposes, but mostly in different contexts. Consequently, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive list of symbols, which would lead to even more confusion. Also, in mechanics and structural analysis, sign conventions present a major hurdle for all students. To ease this problem, easy to remember sign conventions are used systematically. Stresses and force resultants are positive on positive faces when acting along positive coordinate directions. Moments and torques are positive on positive faces when acting about positive coordinate directions using the right-hand rule. In a few instances, new or less familiar terms have been chosen because of their importance in aerospace structural analysis. For instance, the terms “isostatic” and “hyperstatic” structures are used to describe statically determinate and indeterminate structures, respectively, because these terms concisely define concepts that often puzzle and confuse students. Beam bending stiffnesses are indicated with the symbol “H” rather than the more common “EI.” When dealing exclusively with homogeneous material, notation “EI” is easy to understand, but in presence of heterogeneous composite materials, encapsulating the spatially varying elasticity modulus in the definition of the bending stiffness is a more rational approach. It is traditional to use a bold typeface to represent vectors, arrays, and matrices, but this is very difficult to reproduce in handwriting, whether in a lecture or in personal notes. Instead, we have adopted a notation that is more suitable for handwritten notes. Vectors and arrays are denoted using an underline, such as u or F . Unit vectors are used frequently and are assigned a special notation using a single overbar, such as ı ̄1, which denotes the first Cartesian coordinate axis. We also use the over
bar to denote non-dimensional scalar quantities, i.e., k ̄ is a non-dimensional stiffness coefficient. This is inconsistent, but the two uses are in such different contexts that it should not lead to confusion. Matrices are indicated using a double-underline, i.e., C indicates a matrix of M rows and N columns.


X Preface
Finally, we are indebted to the many students at Georgia Tech who have given us helpful and constructive feedback over the past decade as we developed the course notes that are the predecessor of this book. We have tried to constructively utilize their initial confusion and probing questions to clarify and refine the treatment of important but confusing topics. We are also grateful for the many discussions and valuable feedback from our colleagues, Profs. Erian Armanios, Sathya Hanagud, Dewey Hodges, George Kardomateas, Massimo Ruzzene, and Virgil Smith, several of whom have used our notes for teaching advanced aerospace structural analysis here at Georgia Tech.

Basic equations of linear elasticity
Structural analysis is concerned with the evaluation of deformations and stresses arising within a solid object under the action of applied loads. If time is not explicitly considered as an independent variable, the analysis is said to be static; otherwise it is referred to as structural dynamic analysis, or simply structural dynamics. Under the assumption of small deformations and linearly elastic material behavior, threedimensional formulations result in a set of fifteen linear first order partial differential equations involving the displacement field (three components), the stress field (six components) and the strain field (six components). This chapter presents the derivation of these governing equations. In many applications, this complex problem can be reduced to simpler, two-dimensional formulations called plane stress and plane strain problems. For most situations, it is not possible to develop analytical solutions of these equations. Consequently, structural analysis is concerned with the analysis of structural components, such as bars, beams, plates, or shells, which will be addressed in subsequent chapters. In each case, assumptions are made about the behavior of these structural components, which considerably simplify the analysis process. For instance, given a suitable set of assumptions, the analysis of bar and beam problems reduces to the solution of one-dimensional equations for which analytical solutions are easily obtained.
1.1 The concept of stress
1.1.1 The state of stress at a point
The state of stress in a solid body is a measure of the intensity of forces acting within the solid. It can be visualized by cutting the solid by a plane normal to unit vector,  ̄n, to create two free bodies which reveal the forces acting on the exposed surfaces. From basic statics, it is well-known that the distribution of forces and moments that will appear on the surface of the cut can be represented by an equipollent force, F , acting at a point of the surface and a couple, M . Newton’s 3rd law also requires


4 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
a force and couple of equal magnitudes and opposite directions to act on the two surfaces created by the cut through the solid, as depicted in fig. 1.1. (See appendix A for a description of the vector, array and matrix notations used in this text.)

Consider now a small surface of area An located at point P on the surface generated by the cut in the solid. The forces and moments acting on this surface are equipollent to a force, F n, and couple, M n; note that these resultants are, in gen
eral, different, in both magnitude and orientation, from the corresponding resultants acting on the entire surface of the cut, as shown in fig. 1.1. Let the small surface be smaller and smaller until it becomes an element of infinitesimal area dAn → 0. As the surface shrinks to a differential size, the force and couple acting on the element keep decreasing in magnitude and changing in orientation whereas the normal to the surface remains the unit vector  ̄n of constant direction in space. This limiting process gives rise to the concept of stress vector, which is defined as
τ n = lim
dAn →0
( Fn dAn
)
. (1.1)
The existence of the stress vector, i.e., the existence of the limit in eq. (1.1), is a fundamental assumption of continuum mechanics. In this limiting process, it is assumed that the couple, M n, becomes smaller and smaller and, in the limit, M n → 0
as dAn → 0; this is also an assumption of continuum mechanics which seems to be reasonable because in the limiting process, both forces and moment arms become increasingly small. Forces decrease because the area they act on decreases and moment arms decrease because the dimensions of the surface decrease. At the limit, the couple is the product of a differential element of force by a differential element of moment arm, giving rise to a negligible, second order differential quantity. In conclusion, whereas an equipollent couple might act on the entire surface of the cut, the equipollent couple is assumed to vanish on a differential element of area of the same cut. The total force acting on a differential element of area, dAn, is

Fig. 1.2. A rigid body cut at point P by three planes orthogonal to the Cartesian axes.
scribed in the previous paragraph, the surface orientation, as defined by the normal to the surface, is kept constant in space. Had a different normal been selected, a different stress vector would have been obtained. To illustrate this point, consider a solid body and a coordinate system, I, consisting of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors, I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2, ı ̄3), as shown in fig. 1.2. First, the solid is cut at point P by a plane normal to axis ı ̄1; on the surface of the cut, at point P, a differential element of surface with an area dA1 is defined and let τ 1 be
the stress vector acting on this face. Next, the solid is cut at the same point by a plane normal to axis ı ̄2; at point P, let τ 2 be the stress vector acting on the differ
ential element of surface with an area dA2. Finally, the process is repeated a third time for a plane normal to axis ı ̄3; at point P, the stress vector τ 3 is acting on the
differential element of surface with an area dA3. Clearly, three stress vectors, τ 1, τ 2,
and τ 3 are acting at the same point P, but on three mutually orthogonal faces normal
to axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3, respectively. Because these three stress vectors are acting on three faces with different orientations, there is no reason to believe that those stress vectors should be identical. To further understand the state of stress at point P, the components of each stress vectors acting on the three faces are defined
τ 1 = σ1 ı ̄1 + τ12 ı ̄2 + τ13 ı ̄3, (1.3a) τ 2 = τ21 ı ̄1 + σ2 ı ̄2 + τ23 ı ̄3, (1.3b) τ 3 = τ31 ı ̄1 + τ32 ı ̄2 + σ3 ı ̄3. (1.3c)
The stress components σ1, σ2, and σ3 are called direct, or normal stresses; they act on faces normal to axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3, respectively, in directions along axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3, respectively. The stress components τ12 and τ13 are called shearing or shear stresses; both act on the face normal to axis ı ̄1, in directions of axes ı ̄2 and ı ̄3, respectively. Similarly, stress components τ21 and τ23 both act on the face normal to axis ı ̄2, in directions of axes ı ̄1 and ı ̄3, respectively. Finally, stress components τ31 and τ32 both act on the face normal to axis ı ̄3, in directions along axes ı ̄1 and ı ̄2,

respectively. The various stress components appearing in eq. (1.3) are referred to as the engineering stress components. The units of stress components are identical to those of the stress vector, force per unit area, or Pascal. The stress components represented

Fig. 1.3. Sign conventions for the stress components acting on a differential volume element. All stress components shown here are positive.
in fig. 1.2 are all defined as positive. Furthermore, the three faces depicted in this figure are positive faces. A face is positive when the outward normal to the face, i.e., the normal pointing away from the body, is in the same direction as the axis to which the face is normal; a face is negative when its outward normal is pointing in the direction opposite to the axis to which the face is normal. The positive directions of stress components acting on negative faces are the opposite of those for stress components acting on positive faces. This sign convention is illustrated in fig. 1.3, which shows positive stress components acting on the six faces of a cube of differential size. Positive stress components are shown in solid lines on the three positive faces of the cube; positive stress components are shown in dotted lines on the three negative (hidden) faces of the cube. Taken together, the direct stress components σ1, σ2, and σ3 and the shear stress components, τ12 and τ13, τ21 and τ23, and τ31 and τ32, fully characterize the state of stress at point P. It will be shown in a later section that if the stress components acting on three orthogonal faces are known, it is possible to compute the stress components acting at the same point, on a face of arbitrary orientation. This discussion underlines the fact that the state of stress at a point is a complex concept: its complete definition requires the knowledge of nine stress components acting on three mutually orthogonal faces. This should be contrasted with the concept of force. A force is vector quantity that is characterized by its magnitude and orientation. Alternatively, a force can be defined by the three components of the force vector in a given coordinate system. The definition of a force thus requires three quantities, whereas the definition of the stress state requires nine quantities. A force is a vector, which is referred to as a first order tensor, whereas a state of stress is a second order tensor. Several quantities commonly used in solid mechanics are also second order tensors: the strain tensor, the bending stiffnesses of a beam, and the mass moments of inertia of a solid object. The first two of these quantities will be introduced in later sections and chapters. Much like the case for vectors, all second order tensors will be shown to possess certain common characteristics.


1.1 The concept of stress 7
1.1.2 Volume equilibrium equations
In general, the state of stress varies throughout a solid body, and hence, stresses acting on two parallel faces located a small distance apart are not equal. Consider, for instance, the two opposite faces of a differential volume element that are normal to axis ı ̄2, as shown in fig. 1.4. The axial stress component on the negative face at coordinate x2 is σ2, but the stress components on the positive face at coordinate x2 + dx2 will be slightly different and written as σ2(x2 + dx2). If σ2(x2) is an analytic function, it is then possible to express σ2(x2 + dx2) in terms of σ2(x2) using a Taylor series expansion to find
σ2(x2 + dx2) = σ2(x2) + ∂σ2
∂x2
∣∣∣∣x2
dx2 + . . . higher order terms in dx2.
This expansion is a fundamental step in the derivation of the differential equations governing the behavior of a continuum. The stress component on the positive face at coordinate x2 + dx2 can be written as σ2(x2 + dx2) ≈ σ2 + (∂σ2/∂x2)dx2. The same Taylor series expansion technique can be applied to all other direct and shear stress components.

Fig. 1.4. Stress components acting on a differential element of volume. For clarity of the figure, the stress components acting on the faces normal to ı ̄1 are not shown.
Consider now the differential element of volume depicted in fig. 1.4. It is subjected to stress components acting on its six external faces and to body forces per unit volume, represented by a vector b acting at its centroid. These body forces could be gravity forces, inertial forces, or forces of an electric or magnetic origin; the components of this body force vector resolved in coordinate system I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2, ı ̄3) as b = b1 ı ̄1 + b2 ı ̄2 + b3 ı ̄3. The units of the force vector are force per unit volume or Newton per cubic meter.
Force equilibrium
According to Newton’s law, static equilibrium requires the sum of all the forces acting on this differential element to vanish. Considering all the forces acting along

the direction of axis ı ̄1, the equilibrium condition is

)
dx1dx2 + b1 dx1dx2dx3 = 0.
This equation states an equilibrium of forces, and therefore the stress components must be multiplied by the area of the surface on which they act to yield the corresponding force. Similarly, the component of the body force per unit volume of the body is multiplied by the volume of the differential element, dx1dx2dx3, to give the body force acting on the element. After simplification, this equilibrium condition becomes [ ∂σ1

For the same reasons, forces along axes ı ̄2 and ı ̄3 must vanish as well, and a similar reasoning yields the following three equilibrium equations

which must be satisfied at all points inside the body. The equilibrium conditions implied by Newton’s law, eqs. (1.4), have been written by considering an differential element of the undeformed body. Of course, when forces are applied, the body deforms and so does every single differential element. Strictly speaking, equilibrium should be enforced on the deformed configuration of the body, rather than its undeformed configuration. Indeed, stresses are only present when external forces are applied and the body is deformed. When no forces are applied, the body is undeformed, but stresses all vanish. Unfortunately, it is difficult to write equilibrium conditions on the deformed configuration of the body because this configuration is unknown; indeed, the goal of the theory of elasticity is to predict the deformation of elastic bodies under load. It is a basic assumption of the linear theory of elasticity developed here that the displacements of the body under the applied loads are very small, and hence, the


1.1 The concept of stress 9
difference between the deformed and undeformed configurations of the body is very small. Under this assumption, it is justified to impose equilibrium conditions to the undeformed configuration of the body, because it is nearly identical to its deformed configuration.
Moment equilibrium
To satisfy all equilibrium requirements, the sum of all the moments acting on the differential element of volume depicted in fig. 1.4 must also vanish. Consider first the moment equilibrium about axis ı ̄1. The contributions of the direct stresses and of the body forces can be eliminated by choosing an axis passing through the center of the differential element. The resulting moment equilibrium equation is

the moments about axes ı ̄2 and ı ̄3 leads to similar equations,
τ23 = τ32, τ13 = τ31, τ12 = τ21. (1.5)
The implication of these equalities is summarized by the principle of reciprocity of shear stresses, which is illustrated in fig. 1.5.
Principle 1 (Principle of reciprocity of shear stresses) Shear stresses acting in the direction normal to the common edge of two orthogonal faces must be equal in magnitude and be simultaneously oriented toward or away from the common edge.
Another implication of the reciprocity of the shear stresses is that of the nine components of stresses, six only are independent. It is common practice to arrange the stress tensor components in a 3×3 matrix format 

t1 = σ1 n1 + τ12 n2 + τ13 n3, (1.9a) t2 = τ12 n1 + σ2 n2 + τ23 n3, (1.9b) t3 = τ31 n1 + τ32 n2 + σ3 n3. (1.9c)
A body is said to be in equilibrium if eqs. (1.4) are satisfied at all points inside the body, and eqs. (1.9) are satisfied at all points of its external surface.
1.2 Analysis of the state of stress at a point
The state of stress at a point is characterized in the previous section by the normal and shear stress components acting on the faces of a differential element of volume cut from the solid. The faces of this cube are cut normal to the axes of a Cartesian reference frame I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2, ı ̄3), and the stress vector acting on these faces are resolved along the same axes. Clearly, another face at an arbitrary orientation with respect to these axes can be selected. In section 1.2.1, it will be shown that the stresses acting on this face can be related to the stresses acting on the faces normal to axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3. This important result implies that once the stress components are known on three mutually orthogonal faces at a point, they are known on any face passing through that point. Hence, the state of stress at a point is fully defined once the stress components acting on three mutually orthogonal faces at a point are known.
1.2.1 Stress components acting on an arbitrary face
To establish relationships between stresses, it is necessary to consider force or moment equilibrium due to these stresses, and this must be done with reference to a specific free body diagram. Figure 1.7 shows a specific free body constructed from a tetrahedron defined by three faces cut normal to axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3, and a fourth face normal to unit vector  ̄n = n1 ı ̄1 + n2 ı ̄1 + n3 ı ̄3, of arbitrary orientation. This tetrahedron is known as Cauchy’s tetrahedron. The components, n1, n2, and n3, of this unit vector are the direction cosines of unit vector  ̄n, i.e., the cosines of the angles between  ̄n and ı ̄1,  ̄n and ı ̄2, and  ̄n and ı ̄3, respectively. Figure 1.7 shows the stress components acting on faces COB, AOC and AOB, of area dA1, dA2, and dA3, respectively; the stress vector, τn, acts on face ABC of area dAn. The body force vector, b, is also acting on this tetrahedron. Equilibrium of forces acting on tetrahedron OABC requires
τ 1dA1 + τ 2dA2 + τ 3dA3 = τ ndAn + b dV,
where τ 1, τ 2 and τ 3 are the stress vectors acting on the faces normal to axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2,
and ı ̄3, respectively, and dV is the volume of the tetrahedron. Dividing this equilibrium equation by dAn and using eq. (1.8) gives the stress vector acting of the inclined face as

τ n = τ 1n1 + τ 2n2 + τ 3n3 − b dV/dAn
The body force term is multiplied by a higher order term, dV/dAn, which can be neglected in the equilibrium condition. Expanding the three stress vectors in terms on the stress components then yields
τ n = (σ1ı ̄1 +τ12ı ̄2 +τ13ı ̄3) n1 +(τ21ı ̄1 +σ2ı ̄2 +τ23ı ̄3) n2 +(τ31ı ̄1 +τ32ı ̄2 +σ3ı ̄3) n3.
(1.10) To determine the direct stress, σn, acting on face ABC, it is necessary to project this vector equation in the direction of unit vector  ̄n. This can be achieved by taking the dot product of the stress vector by unit vector  ̄n to find
 ̄n · τ n = n ̄· [(σ1ı ̄1 + τ12ı ̄2 + τ13ı ̄3) n1 + (τ21ı ̄1 + σ2ı ̄2 + τ23ı ̄3) n2+ (τ31ı ̄1 + τ32ı ̄2 + σ3ı ̄3) n3] .
Because  ̄n = n1 ı ̄1 + n2 ı ̄1 + n3 ı ̄3, this yields
σn = (σ1n1 + τ12n2 + τ13n3) n1 + (τ21n1 + σ2n2 + τ23n3) n2 + (τ31n1 + τ32n2 + σ3n3) n3,
and finally, after minor a rearrangement of terms,
σn = σ1n21 + σ2n22 + σ3n23 + 2τ23n2n3 + 2τ13n1n3 + 2τ12n1n2. (1.11)
The stress components acting in the plane of face ABC can be evaluated in a similar manner by projecting eq. (1.10) along a unit vector in the plane of face ABC. Consider a unit vector, s ̄ = s1 ı ̄1 + s2 ı ̄1 + s3 ı ̄3, normal to  ̄n, i.e., such that  ̄n · s ̄ = 0. The shear stress component acting on face ABC in the direction of unit vector s ̄ is denoted τns and is obtained by projecting eq. (1.10) along vector s ̄ to find
τns =(σ1s1 + τ12s2 + τ13s3) n1 + (τ21s1 + σ2s2 + τ23s3) n2 + (τ31s1 + τ32s2 + σ3s3) n3,


1.2 Analysis of the state of stress at a point 13
and finally, after minor a rearrangement of terms,
τns = σ1n1s1 + σ2n2s2 + σ3n3s3 + τ12(n2s1 + n1s2)
+ τ13(n1s3 + n3s1) + τ23(n2s3 + n3s2). (1.12)
Equations. (1.11) and (1.12) express an important result of continuum mechanics. They imply that once the stress components acting on three mutually orthogonal faces are known, the stress components on a face of arbitrary orientation can be readily computed. To evaluate the direct stress component acting on an arbitrary face, all that is required are the direction cosines of the normal to the face. Evaluation the shear stress component acting on the same face requires, in addition, the direction cosines of the direction of the shear stress component in that face. Consider the following question: how much information is required to fully define the state of stress at point P of a solid? Clearly, the body can be cut at this point by a plane of arbitrary orientation. The stress vector acting on this face gives information about the state of stress at point P. The stress vector acting on a face with another orientation would give additional information about the state of stress at the same point. If additional faces are considered, each new stress vector provides additional information. This reasoning would seem to imply that the complete knowledge of the state of stress at a point requires an infinite amount of information, specifically, the stress vectors acting on all the possible faces passing through point P. Equations. (1.11) and (1.12), however, demonstrate the fallacy of this reasoning: once the stress vectors acting on three mutually orthogonal faces are known, the stress vector acting on any other face can be readily predicted. In conclusion, complete definition of the state of stress at a point only requires knowledge of the stress vectors, or equivalently of the stress tensor components, acting on three mutually orthogonal faces.
1.2.2 Principal stresses
As discussed in the previous section, eqs. (1.11) and (1.12) enable the computation of the stress components acting on a face of arbitrary orientation, based on the knowledge of the stress components acting on three mutually orthogonal faces. As illustrated in fig. 1.7, the stress vector acting on a face of arbitrary orientation has, in general, a component σn  ̄n, acting in the direction normal to the face, and a component τns s ̄, acting within the plane of the face. This discussion raises the following question: is there a face orientation for which the stress vector is exactly normal to the face? In other words, does a particular orientation,  ̄n, exist for which the stress vector acting on this face consists solely of τ n = σp  ̄n, where σp is the yet unknown magnitude of this direct stress component?
Introducing this expression into eq. (1.10) results in
σp  ̄n = (σ1ı ̄1+τ12ı ̄2+τ13ı ̄3) n1+(τ21ı ̄1+σ2ı ̄2+τ23ı ̄3) n2+(τ31ı ̄1+τ32ı ̄2+σ3ı ̄3) n3.
This equation alone does not allow the determination of both σp and of unit vector  ̄n. Projecting this vector relationship along axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3 leads to the following three scalar equations


14 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
(σ1 − σp) n1 + τ12 n2 + τ13 n3 = 0, τ12 n1 + (σ2 − σp) n2 + τ23 n3 = 0, τ13 n1 + τ23 n2 + (σ3 − σp) n3 = 0,
respectively. The unknowns of the problem are the direction cosines, n1, n2, and n3 that define the orientation of the face on which shear stresses vanish, and the magnitude, σp, of the direct stress component acting on this face. These equations are recast as a homogeneous system of linear equations for the unknown direction cosines 
σ1 − σp τ12 τ13
τ12 σ2 − σp τ23 τ13 τ23 σ3 − σp




n1 n2 n3

 = 0. (1.13)
Since this is a homogeneous system of equations, the trivial solution, n1 = n2 = n3 = 0, is, in general, the solution of this system. When the determinant of the system vanishes, however, non-trivial solutions will exist. The vanishing of the determinant of the system leads to the cubic equation for the magnitude of the direct stress
σp3 − I1σp2 + I2σp − I3 = 0, (1.14)
where the quantities I1, I2, and I3 are defined as
I1 = σ1 + σ2 + σ3, (1.15a)
I2 = σ1σ2 + σ2σ3 + σ3σ1 − τ122 − τ123 − τ223, (1.15b)
I3 = σ1σ2σ3 − σ1τ223 − σ2τ123 − σ3τ122 + 2τ12τ13τ23, (1.15c)
are called the three stress invariants. The solutions of eq. (1.14) are called the principal stresses. Since this is a cubic equation, three solutions exist, denoted σp1, σp2, and σp3. For each of these three solutions, the matrix of the system of equations defined by eq. (1.13) has a zero determinant, and a non-trivial solution exists for the directions cosines that now define the direction of a face on which the shear stresses vanish. This direction is called a principal stress direction. Because the equations to be solved are homogeneous, their solution will include an arbitrary constant, which can be determined by enforcing the normality condition for unit vector  ̄n, n21 + n22 + n23 = 1.
This solution process can be repeated for each of the three principal stresses. This will result in three different principal stress directions. It can be shown that these three directions are mutually orthogonal.
1.2.3 Rotation of stresses
In the previous sections, free body diagrams are formed with faces cut in directions normal to axes of the orthonormal basis I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2, ı ̄3), and the stress vectors are resolved into stress components along the same directions. The orientation of this basis is entirely arbitrary: basis I∗ = (ı ̄1∗, ı ̄2∗, ı ̄3∗) could also have been selected, and


1.2 Analysis of the state of stress at a point 15
an analysis identical to that of the previous sections would have led to the definition of normal stresses σ1∗, σ2∗, σ3∗, and shear stresses τ2∗3, τ1∗3, τ1∗2. A typical equilibrium
equation at a point of the body would be written as
∂σ1∗ ∂x1∗
+ ∂τ2∗1
∂x2∗
+ ∂τ3∗1
∂x3∗
+ b1∗ = 0, (1.16)
where the notation (.)∗ is used to indicate the components of the corresponding quantity resolved in basis I∗. A typical surface traction would be defined as
t1∗ = n1∗ σ1∗ + n2∗ τ2∗1 + n3∗ τ3∗1. (1.17)
Although expressed in different reference frames, eqs. (1.4) and (1.16), or (1.9) and (1.17) express the same equilibrium conditions for the body. Two orthonormal bases, I and I∗, are involved in this problem. The orientation of basis I∗ relative to basis I is discussed in section A.3.1 and leads to the definition of the matrix of direction cosines, or rotation matrix, R, given by eq. (A.36). Consider the stress component σ1∗: it represents the magnitude of the direct stress
component acting on the face normal to axis ı ̄1∗. Equation (1.11) can now be used
to express this stress component in terms of the stress components resolved in axis system I to find
σ1∗ = σ1`21 + σ2`22 + σ3`23 + 2τ23`2`3 + 2τ13`1`3 + 2τ12`1`2, (1.18)
where `1, `2, and `3, are the direction cosines of unit vector ı ̄1∗. Similar equations
can be derived to express the stress components σ2∗ and σ3∗ in terms of the stress
components resolved in axis system I. For σ2∗, the direction cosines `1, `2, and `3
appearing in eq. (1.18) are replaced by direction cosines m1, m2, and m3, respec
tively, whereas direction cosines n1, n2, and n3 will appear in the expression for σ3∗.
Coordinate rotations are defined in appendix A.3. The shear stress components follow from eq. (1.12) as
τ1∗2 = σ1`1m1 + σ2`2m2 + σ3`3m3 + τ12(`2m1 + `1m2)
+ τ13(`1m3 + `3m1) + τ23(`2m3 + `3m2). (1.19)
Here again, similar relationships can be derived for the remaining shear stress components, τ1∗3 and τ2∗3, through appropriate cyclic permutation of the indices.
All these relationships can be combined into the following compact matrix equation 
 σ1∗ τ1∗2 τ1∗3
τ2∗1 σ2∗ τ2∗3
τ3∗1 τ3∗2 σ3∗

 = RT

 σ1 τ12 τ13
τ12 σ2 τ23 τ13 τ23 σ3

 R, (1.20)
where R is the rotation matrix defined by eq. (A.36). This equation concisely encapsulates the relationship between the stress components resolved in two different coordinate systems, and it can be used to compute the stress components resolved in basis I∗ in terms of the stress components resolved in basis I.


16 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
Finally, since the principal stresses at a point are independent of the particular coordinate system used to define the stress state, the coefficients of the cubic equation that determines the principal stresses, eq. (1.14), must be invariant with respect to reference frames. This is the very reason why quantities I1, I2, and I3 defined by eq. (1.15) are called the stress invariants. The word “invariant” refers to the fact that these quantities are invariant with respect to a change of coordinate system. Let I∗ and I be two different orthonormal bases,
I1 = σ1∗ + σ2∗ + σ3∗ = σ1 + σ2 + σ3, (1.21a)
I2 = σ1∗σ2∗ + σ2∗σ3∗ + σ3∗σ1∗ − τ1∗22 − τ1∗32 − τ2∗32
= σ1σ2 + σ2σ3 + σ3σ1 − τ122 − τ123 − τ223, (1.21b)
I3 = σ1∗σ2∗σ3∗ − σ1∗τ2∗32 − σ2∗τ1∗32 − σ3∗τ1∗22 + 2τ1∗2τ1∗3τ2∗3
= σ1σ2σ3 − σ1τ223 − σ2τ123 − σ3τ122 + 2τ12τ13τ23. (1.21c)
Tedious algebra using eqs. (1.20) to write the stress components resolved in basis I∗ in terms of the stresses components resolved in basis I will reveal that the above relationships are correct.
Example 1.1. Computing principal stresses Consider the following stress tensor
S=

−5 −4 0
−4 1 0 01

.
Compute the principal stresses and the principal stress directions. The stress invariants defined by eq. (1.15) are computed as I1 = −3, I2 = −25 and I3 = −21. The principal stress equation, eq. (1.14), now becomes
σp3 + 3σp2 − 25σp + 21 = (σp − 1)(σp2 + 4σp − 21) = 0,
The solutions of this cubic equations yield the principal stresses as σp1 = 3, σp2 = 1 and σp3 = −7. Next, the principal direction associated with σp1 = 3 is computed. The homogeneous system defined by eq. (1.13) becomes 
−8 −4 0
−4 −2 0 0 0 −2




n1 n2 n3

 = 0.
The determinant of this system vanishes because the first two equations are a multiple of each other. The first equation yields n1 = α and n2 = −2α, where α is an arbitrary constant, whereas the third equation gives n3 = 0. Since the principal
direction must be unit vector, n21 + n22 + n23 = 1, or 5α2 = 1; finally n1 = 1/√5,
n2 = −2/√5 and n3 = 0. Proceeding in a similar manner for the other two principal stresses, the three principal directions are found to be

It is easily verified that the principal directions are orthogonal to each other; indeed,  ̄n1 ·  ̄n2 =  ̄n2 ·  ̄n3 =  ̄n3 ·  ̄n1 = 0.
Example 1.2. Principal stresses as an eigenproblem Consider the following stress tensor

 5.0 2.5 −1.3
2.5 7.8 −3.4 −1.3 −3.4 −4.5

Compute the principal stresses and the principal stress directions. Rather than following the procedure described in the previous examples, the homogeneous system of linear equations, eq. (1.13), that govern the problem is recast as 

n1 n2 n3

 . (1.22)
In this form, it becomes clear (see appendix A.2.4) that the determination of the principal stresses and principal stress directions is equivalent to the determination of the three eigenvalues, σp1, σp2 and σp3, of the stress tensor, and determination of the corresponding three eigenvectors,  ̄n1,  ̄n2, and  ̄n3. Using a standard linear algebra software package, the three eigenpairs of the above stress tensor are found to be


.
Here again, it is easily verified that the principal directions are orthogonal to each other by computing  ̄ni· ̄nj for any combination of i and j. This can be represented in a more compact way by creating a matrix, denoted P , that is constructed by arranging the principal stress direction vectors as the columns
P = [n ̄1,  ̄n2,  ̄n3] =

 −0.0640 0.8791 0.4723


.
Because the principal directions are mutually orthogonal unit vectors, this matrix is
orthogonal, that is: P T P = I, where I is the 3 × 3 identity matrix. Furthermore, since matrix P stores the eigenvectors of the stress tensor S, it follows that the transformation P T S P will diagonalize the stress tensor. That is,

Example 1.3. Stresses acting on the octahedral face
Figure 1.8 shows a tetrahedron cut along three faces normal to the principal stress directions defined by axes ı ̄1∗, ı ̄2∗ and ı ̄3∗. The three mutually orthogonal edges of the
tetrahedron each are of unit length. The fourth face of the tetrahedron is the octahedral face which is, by definition, the face that is equally inclined with respect to the
principal stress directions. The normal to the octahedral face is  ̄nT = {1, 1, 1} /√3,
i.e., the direction cosines of this unit vector are 1/√3 with respect to each of the three principal stress directions. Find the stress components acting on the octahedral face.

By definition, the principal stress directions are such that on the corresponding faces, the shear stresses vanish. Hence, fig. 1.8 shows only the principal stress acting on each face. The stress vector acting on the octahedral face can be resolved into the octahedral direct stress vector, σoc  ̄n, acting in the direction normal to the octahedral face, and octahedral shear stress vector, τ oc, acting in the plane of the octahedral
face. Using eq. (1.11), the magnitude of the direct octahedral stress is

lateral triangle with sides of length √2. The octahedral shear stress vector now becomes

1.1.3 Surface equilibrium equations
At the outer surface of the body, the stresses acting inside the body must be in equilibrium with the externally applied surface tractions. Surface tractions are represented by a stress vector, t, that can be resolved in reference frame I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2, ı ̄3) as t = t1 ı ̄1+t2 ı ̄2+t3 ı ̄3. Figure 1.6 shows a free body in the form of a differential tetrahedron bounded by three negative faces cut through the body in directions normal to axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3, and by a fourth face, ABC, of area dAn, which is a differential element of the outer surface of the body. The unit normal to this element of area is denoted  ̄n, and its components in coordinate system I are  ̄n = n1 ı ̄1 + n2 ı ̄2 + n3 ı ̄3. Note that n1, n2, and n3 are the cosines of the angle between  ̄n and ı ̄1,  ̄n and ı ̄2, and  ̄n and ı ̄3, respectively, also called the direction cosines of  ̄n: n1 =  ̄n·ı ̄1 = cos( ̄n, ı ̄1), n2 =  ̄n · ı ̄2 = cos( ̄n, ı ̄2), and n3 =  ̄n · ı ̄3 = cos( ̄n, ı ̄3).

where dA1, dA2, and dA3 are the areas of triangles OBC, OAC and OAB, respectively, and the last term represents the body force times the volume of the tetrahedron.

dA1 = n1dAn, dA2 = n2dAn, and dA3 = n3dAn. (1.8)
Dividing eq. (1.7) by dAn then yields the first component of the surface traction vector
t1 = σ1n1 + τ21n2 + τ31n3,
where the body force term vanishes because it is a higher order differential term. The same procedure can be followed to express equilibrium conditions along the

Problem 1.1. Stresses on an inclined face
Consider the tetrahedron shown in fig. 1.7. A set of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors will
be defined: ` ̄ is a unit vector parallel to vector AB,  ̄m is such that  ̄m =  ̄n × ` ̄, and n ̄ is the normal to face ABC. Let the stress vector acting on face ABC be resolved along these axes,

Problem 1.3. Shear stress distribution over the cross-section of a beam
Figure 1.9 depicts a beam with a rectangular cross-section of a width b and height h.

1.3 The state of plane stress
A particular state of stress of great practical importance is the plane state of stress. In this case, all stress components acting along the direction of axis ı ̄3 are assumed to vanish, or to be negligible compared to the stress components acting in the other two directions. The only non-vanishing stress components are σ1, σ2, and τ12, and furthermore, these stress components are assumed to be independent of x3. This state of stress occurs, for instance, in a very thin plate or sheet subjected to loads applied in its own plane. This type of situation is illustrated by the thin sheet shown in fig. 1.11. For the plane stress state, the two flat surfaces of the thin sheet must be stress free.
1.3.1 Equilibrium equations
The equations of equilibrium derived for the general, three-dimensional case, see eq. (1.4), considerably simplify in the plane stress case. The equation in the ı ̄3 direction is satisfied, and the remaining two equations reduce to
∂σ1 ∂x1
+ ∂τ21
∂x2
+ b1 = 0; ∂τ12
∂x1
+ ∂σ2
∂x2
+ b2 = 0. (1.26)
Similar simplifications take place for the definition of surface tractions in eq. (1.9),
t1 = n1 σ1 + n2 τ21; t2 = n1 τ12 + n2 σ2. (1.27)
For this two-dimensional problem, the boundary of the thin sheet on which externally applied stresses and forces may act is the thin edge defined by the curve C as shown in fig. 1.11. The outer normal to this curve is the unit vector  ̄n = n1 ı ̄1 + n2 ı ̄2 and the tangent direction is the unit vector s ̄ = s1 ı ̄1 + s2 ı ̄2. If θ is the angle between the normal and axis ı ̄1, it follows that n1 = cos θ, n2 = sin θ, n3 = 0 and s1 = − sin θ, s2 = cos θ, s3 = 0. The surface traction component in the direction of vector  ̄n then follows from eq. (1.11) as
tn = cos2 θ σ1 + sin2 θ σ2 + 2 sin θ cos θ τ12, (1.28)


1.3 The state of plane stress 21
and eq. (1.12) yields the surface traction component in the direction of the tangent s ̄ to curve C as
ts = sin θ cos θ(σ2 − σ1) + (cos2 θ − sin2 θ) τ12. (1.29)
Thus, for plane stress problems, the equilibrium equations, eq. (1.26), must be satisfied at all points within the body, and along curve C, the surface equilibrium equations, eq. (1.27), or eqs. (1.28) and (1.29), must be satisfied.

1.3.2 Stresses acting on an arbitrary face within the sheet
Figure 1.12 shows a free body OAB taken from within the thin sheet in fig. 1.11. It is a differential triangle with two sides cut normal to axes ı ̄1 and ı ̄2, and the third side cut normal to a unit vector,  ̄n = n1 ı ̄1 + n2 ı ̄2, at an arbitrary orientation angle θ with respect to axis ı ̄1. Clearly, n1 = cos θ and n2 = sin θ. Triangle OAB is the two-dimensional version of Cauchy’s tetrahedron presented in section 1.2.1 and depicted in fig. 1.7. Hence, the results derived in section 1.2 are directly applicable to the present case. Figure 1.12 shows the stress components acting on sides OA and OB, of length dx1, and dx2, respectively. On side AB, of length ds, the stress vector τn is acting. Finally, the body force vector, b, is also acting on this triangle. For convenience, the thickness of the body in the direction of axis ı ̄3 is taken to be unity. Equilibrium of forces acting on triangle OAB can be expressed by multiplying each of the stress vectors by the area over which they acts, i.e., the length times the unit thickness, and this yields
τ 2dx1 + τ 1dx2 = τ nds + b dx1dx2/2,
where τ 1 and τ 2 are the stress vectors acting on the faces normal to axes ı ̄1 and ı ̄2,
respectively. Dividing this equilibrium equation by ds gives the stress vector acting on the inclined face as


22 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
τ n = τ 1n1 + τ 2n2 − b dx1dx2/2ds
The body force term is multiplied by a higher order differential term, which can neglected. Expanding the stress vectors in terms of the stress components then yields
τ n = (σ1ı ̄1 + τ12ı ̄2) cos θ + (τ21ı ̄1 + σ2ı ̄2) sin θ. (1.30)
The three-dimensional equivalent of this relationship is given by eq. (1.10). Projecting this vector equation in the direction of unit vector  ̄n yields the direct stress component, σn, acting on this face as σn = (σ1 cos θ + τ12 sin θ) cos θ + (τ21 cos θ + σ2 sin θ) sin θ, or after rearrangement,
σn = σ1 cos2 θ + σ2 sin2 θ + 2τ12 cos θ sin θ. (1.31)
Next, eq. (1.30) is projected in the direction normal to unit vector  ̄n. This is in the direction of edge AB, and the direction cosines of this vector with axes ı ̄1 and ı ̄2 are − sin θ and cos θ, respectively. The shear stress component, τns, acting on side AB then becomes τns = (−σ1 sin θ + τ12 cos θ) cos θ + (−τ21 sin θ + σ2 cos θ) sin θ which, after rearrangement, becomes
τns = −σ1 cos θ sin θ + σ2 sin θ cos θ + τ12(cos2 θ − sin2 θ). (1.32)
Equations (1.31) and (1.32) could have been directly derived from their threedimensional equivalent, eqs. (1.11) and (1.12), respectively, by noting that for the plane stress case, n1 = cos θ, n2 = sin θ, n3 = 0 and s1 = − sin θ, s2 = cos θ, s3 = 0.
These important results show that knowledge of the stress components σ1, σ2, and τ12 on two orthogonal faces allows computation of the stress components acting on a face with an arbitrary orientation. In other words, the knowledge of the stress components on two orthogonal faces fully defines the state of stress at a point.
1.3.3 Principal stresses
Principal stresses and their directions can also be determined for plane stress situations. It is a straightforward process to simply write eqs. (1.13), (1.14) and (1.15) with σ3 = τ23 = τ13 = 0. This yields a vanishing principal stress along axis ı ̄3 and a quadratic equation for the remaining two principal stresses, which must lie in plane (ı ̄1, ı ̄2). The computational procedure is otherwise unchanged. It is more interesting, however, to consider eq. (1.31) as defining the direct stress, σn, acting on side AB of triangle OAB, see fig. 1.12. The magnitude of this direct stress is a function of θ, the orientation angle of this face. The particular orientation, θp, that maximizes (or minimizes) the magnitude of this stress component is determined by requiring the vanishing of the derivative of σn with respect to angle θ, to find
dσn
dθ = −2σ1 cos θp sin θp + 2σ2 cos θp sin θp + 2τ12(cos2 θp − sin2 θp) = 0.


1.3 The state of plane stress 23
Using the elementary double-angle trigonometric identities, the orientation of the side that gives the extreme direct stress is found to be
tan 2θp = 2τ12
σ1 − σ2
. (1.33)
This equation possesses two solutions θp and θp+π/2 corresponding to two mutually orthogonal principal stress directions. The maximum axial stress is found along one direction, and the minimum along the other. To determine these axes unambiguously, it is convenient to develop separate equations for both sin 2θp and cos 2αp as follows. If eq. (1.33) is rewritten as
tan 2θp = 2τ12
σ1 − σ2
= sin 2θp
cos 2θp
,
it is then possible to identify sin 2θp = τ12/∆ and cos 2θp = (σ1 − σ2)/2∆, where
∆ is determined by the following trigonometric identity, sin2 2θp + cos2 2θp = 1, to find
∆=
[( σ1 − σ2 2
)2
+ (τ12)2
]1/2
.
Thus, the sine and cosine of angle 2θp can be expressed as follows
sin 2θp = τ12
∆ , cos 2θp = σ1 − σ2
2∆ , (1.34)
where
∆=
√( σ1 − σ2 2
)2
+ τ122. (1.35)
This result is equivalent to eq. (1.33), but it gives a unique solution for θp because both the sine and cosine of the angle are known. The maximum and minimum axial stresses, denoted σp1 and σp2, respectively, act in the directions θp and θp + π/2, respectively. These maximum and minimum axial stresses, called the principal stresses, are evaluated by introducing eq. (1.34) into eq. (1.31) to find
σp1 = σ1 + σ2
2 + ∆; σp2 = σ1 + σ2
2 − ∆. (1.36)
The principal stresses are maximum and minimum values of the axial stress in an algebraic sense. Note that it is possible, however, to have |σp2| > |σp1|. The shear stress acting on the faces normal to the principal stress directions vanishes, as expected. This can be verified by introducing eq. (1.34) into eq. (1.32)
τns = − σ1 − σ2
2 sin 2θp + τ12 cos 2θp = − σ1 − σ2
2
τ12
∆ + τ12

2∆ = 0.
It is also interesting to find the orientation of the faces leading to the maximum value of the shear stress. Indeed, in view of eq. (1.32), the shear stress is also a


24 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
function of the face orientation angle. The orientation, θs, of the face on which the maximum (or minimum) shear stress acts satisfies the following extremal condition
dτns
dθ = − σ1 − σ2

or
tan 2θs = − σ1 − σ2

tan 2θp
, (1.38)
where the last equality follows from eq. (1.34). Here again, this equation presents two solutions, θs and θs + π/2, corresponding to two mutually orthogonal faces. To define these orientations unequivocally, separate definitions of the sine and cosines of angle 2θs are given as follows
sin 2θs = − σ1 − σ2
2∆ ; cos 2θs = τ12
∆ , (1.39)
where ∆ is again given by eq. (1.35). The maximum shear stress acting on these faces results from introducing eq. (1.39) into eq. (1.32) to find
τmax = ∆ = σp1 − σp2
2 . (1.40)
Since tan 2θs = −1/ tan 2θp, trigonometric identities reveal that
θs = θp − π
4 . (1.41)
This means that the faces on which the maximum shear stresses occur are inclined at a 45◦ angle with respect to the principal stress directions. The axial stresses acting on these faces are found by introducing eq. (1.39) into eq. (1.31) and using the first stress invariant property to find
σ1s = σ2s = σ1 + σ2
2 = σp1 + σp2
2 . (1.42)
1.3.4 Rotation of stresses
In the previous sections, faces are cut in planes normal to the two axes of an orthonormal basis I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2), and the stress vectors are resolved into stress components along the same directions. It is clear that the orientation of this basis is entirely arbitrary: an orthonormal basis I∗ = (ı ̄1∗, ı ̄2∗) could have been selected, and an anal
ysis identical to that of the previous sections would have led to the definition of axial stresses σ1∗ and σ2∗, and shear stress τ1∗2. A typical equilibrium equation at a point of
the body would be written as
∂σ1∗ ∂x1∗
+ ∂τ2∗1
∂x2∗
+ b1∗ = 0; (1.43)


1.3 The state of plane stress 25
where the notation (·)∗ is used to indicate the components of the corresponding quantity resolved in I∗. A typical surface traction is be defined as
t1∗ = n1∗ σ1∗ + n2∗ τ2∗1. (1.44)
Although expressed in different reference frames, eqs. (1.26) and (1.43), or (1.27) and (1.44) express the same equilibrium conditions for the body. The problem at hand involves two distinct orthonormal bases, I and I∗, and the relationship between these two basis is developed in appendix A.3.3. Consider the stress component σ1∗: it represents the magnitude of the direct stress
component acting on the face normal to axis ı ̄1∗. Let θ be the angle between unit vector
ı ̄1∗ and axis ı ̄1. Equation (1.31) can now be used to express the stress component σ1∗
in terms of the stress components resolved in axis system I to find
σ1∗ = σ1 cos2 θ + σ2 sin2 θ + 2τ12 sin θ cos θ. (1.45)
A similar equation can be derived to express σ2∗ in terms of the stress components
resolved in axis system I by replacing angle θ by θ + π/2 in the above equation; θ + π/2 is the angle between unit vector ı ̄2∗ and axis ı ̄1.
Finally, the shear stress component can be computed from eq. (1.32) as
τ1∗2 = −σ1 sin θ cos θ + σ2 sin θ cos θ + τ12(cos2 θ − sin2 θ). (1.46)
These results can be combined into a compact matrix form as






σ1 σ2


 . (1.47)
This relationship can be easily inverted by recognizing that the inverse transformation is obtained simply by replacing θ by −θ to find





τσσ1∗12∗∗2

 . (1.48)
With the help of double-angle trigonometric identities, the transformation rules for stress components, eq. (1.47), can also be written in the following useful form
σ1∗ = σ1 + σ2
2 + σ1 − σ2
2 cos 2θ + τ12 sin 2θ, (1.49a)
σ2∗ = σ1 + σ2
2 − σ1 − σ2
2 cos 2θ − τ12 sin 2θ, (1.49b)
τ1∗2 = − σ1 − σ2
2 sin 2θ + τ12 cos 2θ. (1.49c)
These important results show that knowledge of the stress components σ1, σ2, and τ12 on two orthogonal faces allows computation of the stress components acting on a face with an arbitrary orientation. In other words, the knowledge of the stress components on two orthogonal faces fully defines the state of stress at a point.

1.3.5 Special states of stress
Two plane stress states are of particular interest. One is called the hydrostatic stress state and the other is called the pure shear state. A third special state of plane stress is the stress developed in a thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessel. Hydrostatic stress state. A stress state of practical importance is the hydrostatic state of stress. In this case, the principal stresses are equal, i.e., σp1 = σp2 = p, where p is the hydrostatic pressure. It follows from eq. (1.49) that the stresses acting on a face with any arbitrary orientation are
σ1 = σ2 = p, τ12 = 0. (1.50)

tical importance is the state of pure shear characterized by principal stresses of equal magnitude but opposite signs, i.e., σp2 = −σp1, as depicted in fig. 1.13. Equations (1.45) and (1.46) then reveal the direct and shear stresses, respectively, acting on a face inclined at a 45◦ angle with respect to the principal stress directions as
τ1∗2 = −σp1; σ1∗ = σ2∗ = 0. (1.51)
On faces oriented at 45◦ angles with respect to the principal stress directions, the direct stresses vanish and the shear has a maximum value, equal in magnitude to the common magnitudes of the two principal stresses.
Stress state in thin-walled pressure vessels. The stress state in the walls of thin-walled tanks, called pressure vessels, of certain shapes consists of two in-plane normal stresses and an in-plane shear stress. Although the pressure vessel may be subjected to a large internal pressure that will produce a pressure loading on the interior wall in the transverse direction, the magnitude of this stress often is orders of magnitude smaller than the in-plane stress components and is therefore usually neglected. The spherical pressure vessel and a long cylindrical pressure vessel (ignoring the effect of the ends) are two useful examples. A thin-walled (t ø R) cylindrical pressure vessel subjected to an internal pressure, pi, is depicted in fig. 1.14, where it is assumed that the only stresses are the two in-plane stress components, σa in the axial direction, and σh in the circumferential or “hoop” direction, and possibly a shear stress, τah. In the central portion of the cylinder, it is possible to create the simple free body shown in the figure, which will allow direct calculation of these stresses. From axial force equilibrium, it follows that σaπRt = piπR2/2, and hence, σa = piR/2t. Equilibrium in the tangential (hoop) direction implies 2σhbt = pi2Rb, and hence, σh = piR/t. Finally, it should be clear that τah = 0 for this axis orientation. It is left as an exercise to show that by a similar free body analysis of a spherical thin-walled pressure vessel, σa = σh = piR/t in any direction and the shear stress

vanishes. This is a special case of two-dimensional hydrostatic stress. A more formal analysis of pressure vessels is presented in section 4.4.
1.3.6 Mohr’s circle for plane stress
Equation (1.49) expresses the direct and shear stresses acting on a face oriented at an arbitrary angle θ with respect the axis ı ̄1, but the presence of trigonometric functions involving the angle 2θ makes it difficult to give a simple, geometric interpretation of these formulæ. A useful geometric interpretation, however, called Mohr’s circle, can be developed. Let the state of stress at a point be defined by its principal stresses, σp1 and σp2. Equation (1.49) then implies that the stresses acting on a face oriented at an angle θ with respect to the principal stress directions can be written as
σ∗ = σa + R cos 2θ; τ ∗ = −R sin 2θ, (1.52)
where σa = (σp1 + σp2)/2 and R = (σp1 − σp2)/2. With this notation and the help of basic trigonometric identities, eq. (1.52) becomes
(σ∗ − σa)2 + (τ ∗)2 = R2. (1.53)

Fig. 1.16. Mohr’s circle construction procedure.


28 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
This equation clearly represents the equation of a circle, known as Mohr’s circle in which σ∗ is plotted along the horizontal axis, τ ∗ is plotted along the vertical axis, and the circle is centered at a coordinate σa on the horizontal axis with a radius of R,
as depicted in fig. 1.151. The reason for plotting τ ∗ with an inverted axis will become clear in the next paragraphs. Consider point A1 on Mohr’s circle such that segment OA1 makes an angle
2θ with the horizontal. The coordinates of this point are σ∗ = σa + R cos 2θ and
τ ∗ = −R sin 2θ; hence, in view of eq. (1.52), the coordinates of point A1 represent the state of stress on a face oriented at an angle θ. In fact, each point on Mohr’s circle represents the state of stress acting on a face at a specific orientation. An important sign convention must be defined: on Mohr’s circle, a positive angle θ is measured in the counterclockwise direction, see fig. 1.15, to match the positive direction of angle θ that identifies the orientation of a face in fig. 1.12. Given the sign convention for angle θ, the shear stress must be positive downward on the ordinate of Mohr’s circle depicted in fig. 1.15.2 The following observations are made.
• At point P1, the stress state is σ∗ = σp1 and τ ∗ = 0; this corresponds, as expected, to the stress components acting in the principal stress direction. Similar results are found at point P2 which represents the stress components acting in the second principal direction. • At point E1, associated with an angle θ = π/4, the stress components are
τ ∗max = R = (σp1 − σp2)/2 and σ∗ = σa = (σp1 + σp2)/2. These results
are identical to those expressed by eqs. (1.40) and (1.42), respectively. In the graphical representation of stress states given by Mohr’s circle, it becomes obvious that the maximum shear stress is found on faces oriented at ±45◦ angles with respect to the principal stress directions, and this is defined by points E1 and E2 in fig. 1.15. • Points A1 and A2 represent the stress components acting on two faces oriented
90◦ apart. The shear stresses acting on those two faces are equal in magnitude and of opposite sign, as required by the principle of reciprocity of shear stresses illustrated in fig. 1.5. The direct stresses correspond to stresses σ1∗ and σ2∗ in
eqs. (1.49).
In the above discussion, Mohr’s circle is constructed based on the knowledge of the principal stresses represented by points P1 and P2 in figs. 1.15 and 1.16. In practice, it is often the case that the state of stress at a point is defined by known stress components σ1, σ2 and τ12. These three stress components define two diametrically opposed points, A1 and A2, on Mohr’s circle depicted in fig. 1.16. Once this circle is constructed with the help of the procedure described below, the stress components acting on any face rotated by an angle β in a counterclockwise direction, represented
1 A Mohr’s circle representation that describes the rotation of a three-dimensional second order tensor can be constructed but it involves three interdependent circles and is quite tedious to construct and to use. 2 An equivalent construction of Mohr’s circle has the shear stress positive upwards along the ordinate, but angle θ is then positive in the clockwise direction.


1.3 The state of plane stress 29
by points B1 and B2 in fig. 1.16, can be directly obtained from simple geometric constructions.
1. Draw a first point, identified as point A1, at coordinates (σ1, τ12). This represents the direct and shear stresses acting on one face of the solid. 2. Draw a second point, identified as point A2, at coordinates (σ2, −τ12). This
represents the direct and shear stresses acting on a face of the solid at a 90◦ angle counterclockwise with respect to the first face. Since the two faces are 90◦ apart, these two points must define diametrically opposite points on Mohr’s circle. 3. Draw a straight line segment joining points A1 and A2; the intersection of this segment with the horizontal axis defines the center of the Mohr’s circle of diameter A1OA2 at point O. Points A1 and A2 represent the stress components on
two orthogonal faces, that is, on faces of relative orientation θ = 90◦, since the angle between segments OA1 and OA2 is 2θ = 180◦. 4. Once Mohr’s circle is drawn, the stress state on faces at any orientation angle can be computed. For instance, the stress components acting on a face oriented at an angle β from the face on which stress components σ1 and τ12 act can be computed by constructing a new diameter B1OB2 rotated 2β degrees from the reference diameter A1OA2. The coordinates of point B1 yield the new stress components.
Mohr’s circle displays in a graphical manner many important features characterizing the state of stress at a point.
1. The principal stresses, σp1 and σp2, shown in figs. 1.15 and 1.16, are represented by the points P1 and P2 at the intersection of Mohr’s circle with the horizontal axis. Clearly, these points define the orientation of the faces on which the direct stresses take on maximum and minimum values and for which the shear stress vanishes. 2. The faces on which the maximum shear stresses occurs are represented by the points at the intersection of Mohr’s circle with a vertical line passing through its center. It is clear that the magnitude of the maximum shear stress equals the radius of Mohr’s circle: τmax = (σp1 − σp2)/2, see eq. (1.40). The angle between the principal stress directions and those of the face of maximum shear is 45◦, because the angle P1OE1 is 90◦, see eq. (1.41). Finally, the direct stresses acting on the faces of maximum shear equal the average of the principal stresses, σ1s = σ2s = (σp1 + σp2)/2, see eq. (1.42). 3. The stress components acting on two mutually orthogonal faces are represented by two diametrically opposite points on Mohr’s circle. Since the center of the circle is on the horizontal axis, the shear stresses on those two faces are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, as required by the principle of reciprocity of shear stresses illustrated in fig. 1.5.
4. Finally, note that all the points on Mohr’s circle represent the same state of stress at one point of the solid. Of course, this state of stress is represented by stress components that depend on the orientation of the face on which they act.

Mohr’s circle is a graphical representation of all the possible stress components corresponding to a single state of stress.
1.3.7 Lam ́e’s ellipse
Lame ́’s ellipse provides an elegant geometric interpretation of the state of stress at a point. Consider a material in a plane state of stress and let τ n be the stress vector
acting on the face with a unit normal  ̄n at an angle θ with respect to axes ı ̄1∗, as
depicted in fig. 1.17. As angle θ varies, the tip of the stress vector, τ n, draws an
ellipse, called Lam ́e’s ellipse, with its center at O and its semi-axes given by the absolute value of the principal stresses, |σp1| and |σp2|, respectively. The minor and major axes of the ellipse are aligned with the principal stress directions so that axes ı ̄1∗ and ı ̄2∗ are the principal stress directions.

Fig. 1.17. Lame ́’s ellipse. Stress vector τ n corresponds to positive principal stresses whereas
stress vector τ ′n corresponds to σp1 > 0 and σp2 < 0.
To prove the stated claim that the locus of the tip of the stress vector draws the ellipse shown in fig. 1.17, the stress vector acting on the face at an angle θ with respect to axis ı ̄1∗ can be expressed with the help of eq. (1.30) as τ n = σ1p cos θ ı ̄1∗ +
σ2p sin θ ı ̄2∗, where it is noted that σ1 = σ1p, σ2 = σ2p, and τ12 = 0 because the
selected axis system coincides with the principal stress directions. Let x1 and x2 be
the coordinates of the tip of the stress vector, hence, τ n = x1 ı ̄1∗ + x2 ı ̄2∗. It then
follows that x1 = σ1p cos θ and x2 = σ2p sin θ, and elimination of the angle θ using the elementary trigonometric identity leads to

This is the equation of an ellipse with semi-axes equal to |σp1| and |σp2|, respectively, proving the stated claim. As the orientation of the face changes, the tip of the stress vector sweeps around Lame ́’s ellipse. Note that while the shape of the ellipse is not affected by the sign of the principal stresses, the orientation of the stress vector does depend on their sign. For instance, the stress vector τ n shown in fig. 1.17 corresponds to σp1 > 0 and

σp2 > 0; for the case where σp1 > 0 and σp2 < 0, however, the stress vector acting
on the same face is now represented by vector τ ′n.

Fig. 1.18. Lam ́e’s ellipse for the case of pure shear; the three figures illustrate the stress vectors acting on faces at 0, 45, and 90 degrees with respect to axis ı ̄1∗.
An interesting case is provided by the pure shear state of stress discussed in section 1.3.5. This is defined by the principal stresses σ1p = τ and σ2p = −τ : the principal stresses are equal in magnitude but of opposite sign. Since the two semiaxes of Lam ́e’s ellipse are equal, it becomes the circle depicted in fig. 1.18, and hence, the norm of the stress vector remains constant as the face on which it act rotates. When the face is oriented at a 45 degree angle, the stress vector acts at a -45 degree angle with respect to axis ı ̄1∗ and the face is subjected to only a shear stress, as
expected. Finally, note that while the face rotates counterclockwise, the stress vector describes Lame ́’s ellipse in the clockwise direction.

1.4 The concept of strain
The state of strain at a point is a characterization of the deformation in the neighborhood of a material point in a solid. The description of the state of strain at a point is a great deal more complicated than that of the stress state, and the presence of nonlinear terms is much more obvious. The state of strain is concerned with the deformation of a solid in the neighborhood of a given point, say point P, located by a position vector r = x1 ı ̄1 + x2 ı ̄2 + x3 ı ̄3, as depicted in fig. 1.22. To visualize this deformation, a small rectangular parallelepiped PQRST of differential size dx1 by dx2 by dx3 is cut in the neighborhood of point P. The reference configuration is the configuration of the solid in its undeformed state. Under the action of applied loads, the body deforms and assumes a new configuration, called the deformed configuration. All the material particles that formed the rectangular parallelepiped PQRST in the reference configuration now form the parallelepiped PQRST in the deformed configuration. The state of strain at a point characterizes the deformation of the parallelepiped without any consideration for the loads that created the deformation.

Fig. 1.22. The neighborhood of point P in the reference and deformed configurations.
While position vector, r, locates material point P, the displacement vector, u, is a measure of how much a material point moves from the reference to the deformed configuration. The components of the displacement vector resolved in coordinate system I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2, ı ̄3) can be expressed as
u(x1, x2, x3) = u1(x1, x2, x3) ı ̄1 + u2(x1, x2, x3) ı ̄2 + u3(x1, x2, x3) ı ̄3. (1.56)


34 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
This displacement field describes the displacement of a point at position (x1, x2, x3) within the solid and consists of two parts: a rigid body motion and a deformation or straining of the solid. The rigid body motion itself consists of two parts: a rigid body translation and a rigid body rotation. By definition, a rigid body motion does not produce strain in the body. Consequently, the strain-displacement equations must extract from the displacement field the information that describes only the deformation of the body while ignoring its rigid body motion.
1.4.1 The state of strain at a point
A material line is the ensemble of material particles that form a straight line in the reference configuration of the body. For instance, segments PR, PS and PT of the reference configuration are material lines. Due to the deformation of the body, all the material particles forming material line PR will move to segment PR in the deformed configuration. Due to the differential nature of this segment, it can be assumed to remain straight in the deformed configuration. When comparing segment PR in the reference and deformed configurations, the motion consists of two parts: a change in orientation and a change in length. Clearly, the change in length is a deformation or stretching of the material line. Similarly, segments PR and PS form a rectangle in the reference configuration, but they form a parallelogram in the deformed configuration. The angular distortion of the rectangle into a parallelogram represents a deformation of the body. Stretching of a material line and angular distortion between two material lines will be selected as measures of the state of strain at a point. The stretching or relative elongations of material lines PR, PS and PT will be denoted as ≤1, ≤2 and ≤3, respectively. The angular distortions between segments PS and PT, PR and PT, and PR and PS will be denoted γ23, γ13, and γ12, respectively.
Relative elongations or extensional strains
The relative elongation, ≤1, of material line PR is defined as
≤1 = ‖PR‖def − ‖PR‖ref
‖PR‖ref
, (1.57)
where the subscripts (·)ref and (·)def are used to indicate the reference and deformed configurations, respectively, and ‖ · ‖ means magnitude of a vector. The relative elongation is a non-dimensional quantity. The length of the material line in the reference configuration is
‖PR‖ref = ‖dx1 ı ̄1‖ = dx1, (1.58)
whereas in the deformed configuration, it is

A fundamental assumption of linear elasticity is that all displacement components remain very small so that all second order terms can be neglected. This can be stated as requiring
∣∣∣∣ ∂u1
∂x1
∣∣∣∣ ø 1,
∣∣∣∣ ∂u2
∂x1
∣∣∣∣ ø 1,
∣∣∣∣ ∂u3
∂x1
∣∣∣∣ ø 1,
∣∣∣∣ ∂u1
∂x2
∣∣∣∣ ø 1, etc. (1.61)
With these assumptions and by making use of the binomial expansion3, the expression for the relative elongation given in eq. (1.60) reduces to
≤1 ≈ 1 + ∂u1
∂x1
− 1 = ∂u1
∂x1
. (1.62)
A similar reasoning applied to material lines PS and PT yields expressions for the three components of relative elongation
≤1 = ∂u1
∂x1
, ≤2 = ∂u2
∂x2
, ≤3 = ∂u3
∂x3
. (1.63)
Angular distortions or shear strains
The angular distortion, γ23, between two material lines PT and PS is defined as the change of the initially right angle
γ23 = 〈T P S〉ref − 〈T P S〉def = π
2 − 〈T P S〉def , (1.64)
where the notation 〈T P S〉 is used to indicate the angle between segments PT and PS. Both relative elongation and angular distortion are non-dimensional quantities. To eliminate the difference between the two angles, basic properties of the sine function are used: the sine of the angular distortion becomes
3 When |a| ø 1, it is possible to expand (1 ± a)n ≈ 1 ± na.


36 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
sin γ23 = sin

The cosine of the angle between the two material lines is computed from the law of cosines applied to triangle T P S in the deformed configuration
‖TS‖2def = ‖PT‖2def + ‖PS‖2def − 2 cos〈T P S〉def ‖PT‖def ‖PS‖def . (1.66)
The angular distortion thus becomes
γ23 = arcsin ‖PT‖2def + ‖PS‖2def − ‖TS‖2def
2‖PT‖def ‖PS‖def
. (1.67)
The same procedure as used above in determining ≤1 can be used to compute ‖PR‖def and ‖PS‖def but since the present computations are a bit more tedious, it will be convenient to introduce two temporary vectors, A an B, defined as follows
PTdef =
(

)
dx3 = A, PSdef =
(
ı ̄2 + ∂u

dx2 = B,
and hence
TSdef = PSdef − PTdef = B − A.
With the help of this notation, the numerator, N , of eq. (1.67) becomes
N = A · A + B · B − (B − A) · (B − A) = 2A · B

(1.69)
Finally, these results can be combined in eq. (1.67) to yield the rather cumbersome expression γ23 = arcsin N/D. With the help of the small displacement assumption, see eq. (1.61), the numerator simplifies to N ≈ 2(∂u2/∂x3 + ∂u3/∂x2) dx2dx3, whereas the denominator reduces to D ≈ 2(1+ ∂u2/∂x2 + ∂u3/∂x3) dx2dx3. With these simplifications, the shearing strain component becomes
γ23 ≈ ∂u2/∂x3 + ∂u3/∂x2

Summary
The relative elongations, eqs. (1.63), and angular distortions, eqs. (1.71) characterize the state of deformation at a point. The relative elongations are also called direct strains or axial strains, whereas the angular distortions are called shearing strains or simply shear strains. It is important to note that the strain-displacement relationships, eqs. (1.63) and (1.71) are obtained under the small displacement assumption defined in eq. (1.61). If the displacements become large, expressions (1.60) and (1.67) should be used instead. It is clear that the small displacement assumption implies that all strain components also remain very small, i.e.,
|≤1| ø 1, |≤2| ø 1, |≤3| ø 1, |γ23| ø 1, |γ13| ø 1, |γ12| ø 1. (1.72)
Rigid body rotation
In general, the motion of a solid body can be decomposed into a rigid body motion and straining or deformation. The previous sections are focused on the deformation of the solid, but the rigid body motion can also be extracted from the displacement field. The components of the rotation vector associated with the displacement field are

. (1.73c)
Each components of the rotation vector ωT = {ω1, ω2, ω3
} represent the rotation of the solid about axes ı ̄1, ı ̄2, and ı ̄3, respectively.
1.4.2 The volumetric strain
Consider the block of material defined by the three segments PR, PS, and PT. The volume of this block in the reference configuration is dx1dx2dx3. After deformation, this volume becomes
V ≈ (1 + ≤1)(1 + ≤2)(1 + ≤3) dx1dx2dx3 ≈ (1 + ≤1 + ≤2 + ≤3) dx1dx2dx3, (1.74)


38 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
where the higher order strain quantities are neglected in view of eq. (1.72). The relative change in volume is now
e = (1 + ≤1 + ≤2 + ≤3) dx1dx2dx3 − dx1dx2dx3
dx1dx2dx3
= ≤1 + ≤2 + ≤3. (1.75)
The quantity e is known as the volumetric strain and measures the relative change in volume of the material.
1.5 Analysis of the state of strain at a point
The state of strain at a point is characterized in the previous section by the relative elongations of three material lines and their relative angular distortions. The orientations of three material lines are selected parallel to the axes of the Cartesian reference frame I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2, ı ̄3). It is clear that the orientation of this reference frame is entirely
arbitrary: a reference frame I∗ = (ı ̄1∗, ı ̄2∗, ı ̄3∗) could have been selected, and an analy
sis identical to that of the previous section would have led to the definition of relative elongations

. (1.77)
Although expressed in different reference frames, the strain displacements equations, eq. (1.63) and (1.71), or (1.76) and (1.77) both characterize the state of deformation at a point of the body. Therefore, the strain components resolved in the two reference frames should be closely related. Because strain components are purely geometric in nature, it should not be unexpected that the relationship between the strain components resolved in two different coordinate systems is also purely geometric in nature.
1.5.1 Rotation of strains
In this section, the strain components resolved two different bases, I and I∗, will be related to each other. The orientation of basis I∗ relative to basis I is discussed in appendix A.3.1 and leads to the definition of the matrix of direction cosines, or rotation matrix, R, given by eq. (A.36). With the help of the chain rule for derivatives, the first component of strain given by eq. (1.76) becomes

components in coordinate system I with the help of eq. (A.39), to find

≤1∗ = ≤1`21 + ≤2`22 + ≤3`23 + γ12`1`2 + γ13`1`3 + γ23`2`3.

2 (m2n3 + m3n2). (1.81c)
Expressions (1.80) and (1.81) are quite tedious, but the permutations of indices are readily observed. In these equations, it should be noted that the shear strain components are divided by a factor of 2. In this form, eqs. (1.80) and (1.81) become similar to eqs. (1.11) and (1.12), respectively; the axial strain take the place of the axial stresses and the shear strain that of the shear stresses. The shearing strain components γ23, γ13 and γ12 are called the engineering shear strain components, whereas the tensor shear strain components, ≤23, ≤13 and ≤12, are defined as
≤23 = γ23
2 , ≤13 = γ13
2 , ≤12 = γ12
2 . (1.82)
When using the tensor strain components, the strain rotation expressions, eqs. (1.80) and (1.81), can be written in a compact matrix form as

where R is the rotation matrix defined by eq. (A.36). Comparing this result with eq. (1.20) for the rotation of stress components, it becomes clear that the transformation equations for these second order tensors are identical. Equation (1.20) expresses the transformation rules for the components of the second order stress tensor, whereas eq. (1.83) expresses the same rule for the second order strain tensor. In fact, a second order tensor is defined as a mathematical entity whose components measured in two different coordinate systems transform according to the ruled expressed by eqs. (1.20) or (1.83).
1.5.2 Principal strains
Because it has been established that stress and strain components are the components of the second order stress and strain tensors, respectively, it should not be unexpected that the concept of principal stresses, discussed in section 1.2.2 for the stress tensor, has its equivalent when it comes to the strain tensor. To introduce the concept of principal strains, the following question is asked: is there a coordinate system I∗ for which the shear strains vanish? If such a coordinate system exists, eq. (1.83) implies that 

Clearly, this homogeneous system is equivalent to system (1.13) that defines the principal stresses. Since this is a homogeneous system of equations, the trivial solution, n1 = n2 = n3 = 0, is, in general, the solution of this system. When the determinant of the system vanishes, however, non-trivial solutions will exist. The vanishing of the determinant of the system leads to a cubic equation for the magnitude of the principal strains given by
≤3p − I1≤2p + I2≤p − I3 = 0, (1.85) where the quantities, I1, I2, and I3, defined as
I1 = ≤1 + ≤2 + ≤3, (1.86a)
I2 = ≤1≤2 + ≤2≤3 + ≤3≤1 − ≤212 − ≤213 − ≤223, (1.86b)
I3 = ≤1≤2≤3 − ≤1≤223 − ≤2≤213 − ≤3≤212 + 2≤12≤13≤23, (1.86c)
are called the three strain invariants. The solutions of eq. (1.85) are called the principal strains. Because this is a cubic equation, there will be three solutions, denoted ≤p1, ≤p2, and ≤p2. For each of these three solutions, the matrix of the system of equations defined by eq. (1.84) has a zero determinant, and a non-trivial solution exists for the directions cosines that now define the direction for which the shear strains vanish. Such direction is called a principal strain direction. Because the equations to be solved are homogeneous, their solution will include an arbitrary constant which can be determined by enforcing the normality condition for unit vector  ̄n, n21 + n22 + n23 = 1.
Since there exist three principal strains, three principal strain directions must also exist. It can be shown that these three directions are mutually orthogonal.
1.6 The state of plane strain
A particular state of strain of great practical importance is the plane state of strain. In this case, the displacement component along the direction of axis ı ̄3 is assumed to vanish, or to be negligible compared to the displacement components in the other two directions. This means that the only non-vanishing strain components are ≤1, ≤2, and γ12, and furthermore, these strain components are assumed to be independent of x3.
Unlike the plane state of stress considered in section 1.3, plane strain problems are not characterized by having one dimension much thinner than the others. Instead, displacement in one direction is zero. An example of a plane strain problem is that of a very long buried pipe aligned with the ı ̄3 direction. Such a problem is clearly three-dimensional in its overall geometry, but if the displacement along the direction of axis ı ̄3 is small or negligible, the pipe is in a plane state of strain.
1.6.1 Strain-displacement relations for plane strain
If the material is in a plane state of strain, i.e., if u3 = 0 and ∂/∂x3 = 0, eqs (1.63) and (1.71) reduce to

1.6.2 Rotation of strains
Next, the strain components measured two different orthonormal bases, I and I∗, will be related to each other. Since this problem involves two distinct orthonormal bases, the relationship between these two basis, as explored in appendix A.3.3, is relevant to this development. With the help of the chain rule for derivatives, the first component of strain given by eq. (1.76) becomes

where eq. (A.43) is used to express the derivatives of x1 and x2 with respect to
x1∗. Next, the displacement component u1∗ is expressed in terms of the displacement
components resolved in coordinate system I with the help of eq. (A.43) to yield
≤1∗ = cos θ ∂
∂x1
(u1 cos θ + u2 sin θ) + sin θ ∂
∂x2
(u1 cos θ + u2 sin θ) . (1.88)
The last step is to use the strain-displacement relationships, eqs. (1.87), to find
≤1∗ = cos2 θ ≤1 + sin2 θ ≤2 + sin θ cos θ γ12. (1.89)
Proceeding in a similar manner yields the shear strain components in the I∗ coordinate system
γ1∗2
2 = −≤1 cos θ sin θ + ≤2 sin θ cos θ + γ12
2 (cos2 θ − sin2 θ). (1.90)
Here again, it is convenient to use the tensor component of shearing strain, ≤12 = γ12/2, see eq. (1.82). These results can be written in a matrix form as 

This relationship can be readily inverted by recognizing that the inverse transformation is obtained by replacing θ by −θ to find

Note that these transformation formulæ are identical to those derived for the stress tensor, see eqs. (1.47) and (1.48), respectively.


1.6 The state of plane strain 43
With the help of double-angle trigonometric identities, the transformation equations for tensor strain components, eq. (1.91), can also be written as
≤1∗ = ≤1 + ≤2
2 + ≤1 − ≤2
2 cos 2θ + ≤12 sin 2θ, (1.93a)
≤2∗ = ≤1 + ≤2
2 − ≤1 − ≤2
2 cos 2θ − ≤12 sin 2θ, (1.93b)
≤1∗2 = − ≤1 − ≤2
2 sin 2θ + ≤12 cos 2θ. (1.93c)
While use of the strain tensor components, ≤ij, renders the treatment of stress and strain component rotation formulæ identical, it is customary to use the engineering shear strain components, γij, instead of their tensor counterparts, and hence, the previous equations become
≤1∗ = ≤1 + ≤2
2 + ≤1 − ≤2
2 cos 2θ + γ12
2 sin 2θ, (1.94a)
≤2∗ = ≤1 + ≤2
2 − ≤1 − ≤2
2 cos 2θ − γ12
2 sin 2θ, (1.94b)
γ1∗2 = − (≤1 − ≤2) sin 2θ + γ12 cos 2θ. (1.94c)
This important result shows that knowledge of the plane strain components ≤1, ≤2, and γ12 in two orthogonal directions allows the computation of the strain components in an arbitrary orientation. In other words, the knowledge of the plane strain components in two orthogonal directions fully defines the state of strain at that point.
1.6.3 Principal strains
The relative elongation in an arbitrary direction, θ, can be computed with the help of eq. (1.94). The orientation, θp, in which the maximum (or minimum) elongation
occurs is determined by requiring the derivative of ≤1∗ with respect to θ to vanish, and
this yields d≤1∗
dθ = − ≤1 − ≤2
2 2 sin 2θp + γ12
2 2 cos 2θp = 0. (1.95)
This can be solved for 2θp to find the orientation of extreme elongation as
tan 2θp = γ12/2
(≤1 − ≤2)/2 , (1.96)
where the factor 2 has not been canceled out in order to retain the similarity with eq. (1.33) if τ12 is replaced with γ12/2 and σ1 and σ2 with ≤1 and ≤2, respectively. This equation presents two solutions, θp1 and θp2 = θp1 +π/2, corresponding to two mutually orthogonal principal strain directions. The maximum axial strain is found along one direction, and the minimum is found along the other. To define these orientations unequivocally, it is convenient to separately define the sine and cosines of angle 2θp as follows


44 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity

2∆ , (1.97)
where
∆=
√( ≤1 − ≤2 2
)2
+
( γ12 2
)2. (1.98)
This result is equivalent to eq. (1.96), but it gives a unique solution for θp because both the sine and cosine of the angle are known. The maximum and minimum axial strains, denoted ≤p1 and ≤p2, respectively, act in the directions θp1 and θp2 = θp1 + π/2, respectively. These maximum and minimum axial strains, called the principal strains, are evaluated by introducing eq. (1.97) into eq. (1.94) to find
≤p1 = ≤1 + ≤2
2 + ∆; ≤p2 = ≤1 + ≤2
2 − ∆. (1.99)
Finally, the shear strain in the principal directions vanishes as can be verified by introducing eq. (1.97) into eq. (1.94). The development of the equations for the state of strain at a point yield equations that are very similar to those developed in section 1.2.2 for the state of stress at a point. In particular, the transformation equations are similar in form (identical if the strain tensor components, ≤12 = γ12/2, are used to define the shear strain) and lead in both cases to the existence of principal stresses and principal strains. The orientations of the principal stresses and principal strains are not necessarily identical.
1.6.4 Mohr’s circle for plane strain
Equations (1.94) express the direct and shear strains along an arbitrary direction defined by angle θ with respect the axis ı ̄1, but the presence of trigonometric functions involving the angle 2θ makes it difficult to give a geometric interpretation of these formulae. Let the state of strain at a point be defined by its principal strains, ≤p1 and ≤p2; eq. (1.94) then implies that the strains along a direction defined by angle θ with respect to the principal strain directions can be written as
≤∗ = ≤a + R cos 2θ, γ∗
2 = −R sin 2θ, (1.100)
where ≤a = (≤p1 + ≤p2)/2, and R = (≤p1 − ≤p2)/2. With this notation and the help of trigonometric identities, eq. (1.100) becomes
(≤∗ − ≤a)2 +
( γ∗
2
)2
= R2. (1.101)
This equation represents the equation of a circle which is known as Mohr’s circle. When ≤∗ is plotted along the horizontal axis and γ∗/2 along the vertical axis, the center of the circle is at a coordinate ≤a on the horizontal axis, and the radius of the circle is R, as depicted in fig. 1.23.


1.7 Measurement of strains 45
Consider now point A1 on Mohr’s circle such that segment OA1 makes an an
gle 2θ with the horizontal. The coordinates of this point are ≤∗ = ≤a + R cos 2θ and
γ∗/2 = −R sin 2θ; hence, in view of eq. (1.100), the coordinates of point A1 represent the strain components along a direction defined by angle θ. In fact, each point on Mohr’s circle represents the strain components along a specific orientation.

defined: on Mohr’s circle, a positive angle θ is measured in the counterclockwise direction, see fig. 1.23, to match the positive direction of angle θ that identifies the orientation of a face in fig. 1.12. Given the sign convention for angle θ, the shear strain must be positive downward on the ordinate of Mohr’s circle depicted in fig. 1.23.4 All the developments presented in section 1.3.6 for visualizing a plane state of stress using Mohr’s circle also apply to the present problem of visualizing the plane state of strain, provided however, that the strain tensor is used. This means that γ12/2 must be plotted on the vertical axis.
1.7 Measurement of strains
The goal of the theory of elasticity is to predict the state of stress at any point of an elastic body, given the applied loading. Such predictions must be validated by measuring the state of stress at specific points of a body, then comparing these measurements with the corresponding predictions. Unfortunately, no practical experimental device can measure stresses directly. An indirect measurement must therefore be made by first measuring the state of strain, then computing the corresponding state of stress using the constitutive laws for the material.
Strain gauges
Measurement of the state of strain itself is not an entirely straightforward process. First, it is relatively difficult to measure the strain state at an interior point of a solid body, so most measurement methods focus on measuring strains on the body’s external surface. As noted in previous sections, the two-dimensional strain state is characterized by both direct and shear components. Measurements of the very small angular changes associated with shear strains are difficult to perform, but measurements of extensional strains on a surface are surprisingly easy to acquire. The relative elongation at the surface of a body can be measured with the help of what are called electrical resistance strain gauges, or more simply strain gauges. This device consists of a very thin electric wire, or an etched foil pattern, which is glued to the surface of the solid. When the solid experiences an extensional strain, this strain is transferred through the glue to the gauge, hence increasing the length
4 An equivalent construction of Mohr’s circle has the shear strain positive upwards along the ordinate, but angle θ is then positive in the clockwise direction.


46 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
of the wire. In turn, the wire’s cross-section is reduced by Poisson’s effect, thereby slightly increasing its electrical resistance. The reverse happens for compressional strains, and the electrical resistance is slightly reduced in this case. An accurate electrical measurement of this resistance change, using a Wheatstone bridge circuit for instance, yields an estimate of the length change, which in turn, allows an accurate estimate of the relative elongation and finally, the extensional strain in the direction of the wire. Because strain quantities are very small, strain measurements are often labeled in micro-strains, which indicates a relative elongation of μ m/m = 10−6 m/m. Because strains are non-dimensional quantities, the units employed for measurement of elongation can be any units of length.
Chevron strain gauge
Figure 1.24 shows the external surface of a body with two strain gauges forming at a 90 degree angle with respect to each other; this configuration is sometimes called chevron strain gauge. This device is of finite size, and hence, the two extensional strain measurements are not made exactly at the same point, but if the chevron strain gauge is very small and the strain gradients are small compared to its size, it can be assumed that the two gauges experience the same strain state. Let e+45 and e−45 be the experimentally measured relative elongations in the two gauge directions. The two gauges of the chevron are oriented at ± 45 degrees with respect to a triad, I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2), as shown in fig. 1.24. The state of strain at that point is defined by the three strain components, ≤1, ≤2, and γ12, resolved in triad I. With the help of eq. (1.94a), these measurements can be expressed as follows
e+45 = ≤1 + ≤2
2 + ≤1 − ≤2
2 cos(2 × 45◦) + γ12
2 sin(2 × 45◦) = ≤1 + ≤2
2 + γ12
2,
e−45 = ≤1 + ≤2
2 + ≤1 − ≤2
2 cos(2 × 135◦) + γ12
2 sin(2 × 135◦) = ≤1 + ≤2
2 − γ12
2.
Clearly, the two measurements, e+45 and e−45, are not sufficient to determine the strain state at the chevron’s location. Indeed, three measurements would be required to determine the three strain components, ≤1, ≤2, and γ12. It is possible, however, to unequivocally determine the shear strain by subtracting the above equations from each other to find
γ12 = e+45 − e−45. (1.102)
Adding the two equations yields ≤1 + ≤2 = e+45 + e−45, but the two normal strain components, ≤1 and ≤2, cannot be determined individually. The complete state of strain at the surface of the body is specified by three independent quantities, i.e., either two extensional and a shear strain, or two principal strains and a principal direction. These can be computed from the measurement of relative elongation in three distinct directions on the surface.

Strain gauge rosette
The experimental determination of the strain state at the surface of a body requires three independent measurements. One approach is to locate three strain gauges forming an equilateral triangle at the external surface of a body, as depicted in fig. 1.25. This type of device is commonly referred to as a strain gauge rosette; the configuration shown in the figure is often called a “delta rosette.” Once again, this rosette is of finite size, and hence, the three extensional strain measurements are not made exactly at the same point, but if the rosette is very small and the strain gradients are small compared to the size of the rosette, it can be assumed that the three gauges experience the same strain state. Let e1, e2, and e3 be the experimentally measured relative elongations in the three gauge directions. With the help of eq. (1.94a), these measurements can be related to the strain components measured in triad I = (ı ̄1, ı ̄2) as follows
e1 = ≤1 + ≤2
2 + ≤1 − ≤2
2,
e2 = ≤1 + ≤2

and the principal strains are

where e ̄ = (e1 + e2 + e3)/3 and ∆ = 2/3 √e21 + e22 + e23 − e2e3 − e1e3 − e1e2.


48 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
Various commonly used strain gauge arrangements are depicted in fig. 1.26. Note that a complete evaluation of the state of strain requires the knowledge of three strain components, and thus requires three independent measurements in three distinct directions. Combinations (a) and (c) of fig. 1.26 provide three independent measurements from which the strain state can be evaluated using a similar approach to that developed above for the delta strain gauge rosette shown in fig. 1.25. Combinations (B) and (D) allow four independent measurements to be made to provide enough information in the event when one of the gauges is damaged. If the four gauges are properly working, the redundant information can be used to compensate for experimental errors, as illustrated in example 1.4 for the T-Delta rosette.

These equations form an over-determined set of equations to evaluate the three components of strain. Since the strain measurement are likely to involve experimental errors, it seems appropriate to solve the over-determined system in a least squares sense, as explained in appendix A.2.10.

Consider the strain gauge arrangements shown in fig. 1.26 D. If the strain measurements e1, e2 and e4 are given, find the strain e3.
Problem 1.19. Misaligned Delta rosette
The delta rosette depicted in fig. 1.27 has been improperly installed on a solid: instead of aligning the rosette with axes ı ̄1 and ı ̄2, as desired, the gage was installed at an angle θ with
respect to the desired directions. This implies that the gauge measurements will be e1∗, e2∗ and
e3∗, instead of the desired e1, e2 and e3. Since the misalignment is unintentional, the experi
mentalist will use the measurements, e1∗, e2∗ and e3∗, as if they were e1, e2 and e3, respectively.


50 1 Basic equations of linear elasticity
In other words, he will use the measurements e1∗, e2∗ and e3∗ to extract the strain state, thinking that θ = 0. (1) If the strain state is ≤1 = 1245μ, ≤2 = −780μ and γ12 = 675μ, determine the state of strain that the experimentalist will erroneously extract, denoted ≤ˆ1, ≤ˆ2 and γˆ12, as function of the misalignment angle. (2) On one graph, plot the relative errors (≤ˆ1 − ≤1)/≤1, (≤ˆ2 − ≤2)/≤2 and (γˆ12 − γ12)/γ12, as functions of θ ∈ [−10, 10] degrees.

Problem 1.20. Transverse shear strain in beams
In beam theory, it is assumed that the planar cross-section of the beam remains planar and remains perpendicular to the axis of the beam as it bends. This implies that two material lines, the axis of the beam and a material line in the plane of the cross-section, remain perpendicular to each other. In view of this assumption, what is the transverse shear strain along the axis of the beam?
1.8 Strain compatibility equations
The displacement field uniquely defines the deformation of a solid body. Six strain components, however, are defined to characterize the state of deformation at a point. Hence, the strain components are not independent and must satisfy a set of relationships called the strain compatibility equations. Consider the following derivatives of the shear strain components

Some reflection is needed to fully understand the need for stating the compatibility equations. Clearly, if the state of deformation is defined by the three components of the displacement vector, i.e., if the displacement field is given, it is a simple matter to compute the six strain components using eqs. (1.63) and (1.71). The inverse problem, however, is not so simple: if the state of deformation is defined by six components of strain, i.e., given the strain field, it is not obvious to determine the displacement components that give rise to this strain field. Indeed, the six strain components are generated based on three displacement components only. Furthermore, some strain states could possibly be associated with displacement fields that include discontinuities or jumps corresponding to gaps or tears in the continuous body. In summary, if the six components of the strain field are derived from the three components of the displacement field, they are not independent and must satisfy SaintVenant’s strain compatibility equations. Three only of the six compatibility equations are independent.

Constitutive behavior of materials
The solution of elasticity problems requires three types of relationships. First, the equilibrium equations discussed in section 1.1.2, second, the strain-displacement relationships of section 1.4.1. Finally, the stress and strain fields must be related through a set of constitutive laws. These constitutive laws characterize the mechanical behavior of the material and consist of a set of mathematical idealizations of their observed behavior.
Homogeneity and isotropy
Constitutive laws for homogeneous, isotropic materials will be presented first. A homogeneous material is a material for which the physical properties are identical at each point within the sample. An isotropic material is a material for which the physical properties are identical in all directions. A sample of mild steel or aluminum can usually be assumed to be both homogeneous and isotropic. Many engineering materials, however, are neither homogeneous nor isotropic. Consider a composite material consisting of long fibers aligned along a single direction and embedded in a matrix material. Such material is not homogeneous: the properties of the fibers are, in general, very different from those of the matrix material. Furthermore, it is not isotropic: if loading is applied along the fibers, the response of the material is likely to be very different from that observed when the loading is applied in a direction transverse to the fiber orientation. Such a material is referred to as being heterogeneous and anisotropic and will be examined in the second half of this chapter. The assumptions of homogeneity or isotropy are scale dependent. For instance, it seems reasonable to consider a sample of aluminum to be both homogeneous and isotropic. Of course, at the atomic level, aluminum is neither homogeneous nor isotropic. Hence, assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy only hold for samples containing a very large number of atoms. For high temperature turbine blade applications, either poly-crystalline or single crystal materials might be used. For single crystal materials, the atoms are arranged


54 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
to form regular lattice structures that create a clearly defined orientation in the material. In such a case, a sample containing a large number of atoms could be assumed to be homogeneous but anisotropic, because the response of the material will be different when stresses are applied in different directions with respect to the lattice directions. For poly-crystalline material samples containing a large number of crystals, the material could be considered homogeneous, but if the crystals are generally oriented in a specific direction, the material will be anisotropic. This can be the case for forged metals where the forging process aligns the crystals. For poly-crystalline material samples containing a large number of crystals arranged at random orientations with respect to each other, the material can be considered both homogeneous and isotropic, and this is often the case for common structural metals such as steel and aluminum. For composite material reinforced with long fibers all aligned in the same direction, the material is clearly anisotropic because the fiber direction defines a preferential direction for the material. For samples containing just a few fibers, the material is not homogeneous, whereas for samples containing a very large number of fibers it is a reasonable assumption to consider the material to be homogeneous.
Material testing
At present, no first-principles based models models accurately describe the constitutive properties of structural materials. Most practical constitutive models are based on empirical data, and various types of constitutive laws have been proposed to represent the many types of experimentally observed material behaviors.

very small, however, the stress-strain relationship can often be assumed to be linear. This widely used approximation, in which stress is proportional to strain, will be discussed in section 2.1.1. As the magnitude of the deformation increases, the stress-strain relationship can no longer be assumed to remain linear. The stress-strain relationship for large deformations has distinctly different characteristics depending on whether the material is ductile or brittle. Constitutive relationships for ductile materials are presented in section 2.1.4 and relationships for brittle materials are presented in section 2.1.5. Typically, material behavior is characterized by carrying out a tensile test similar to that sketched in fig. 2.1, in which a bar of circular cross-sectional area, A, is loaded in a testing machine that applies an axial force, N , to the test specimen. The test section is a representative portion of the test specimen of length, `, located at a sufficient distance away from the grips of the testing machine to avoid the end effects


2.1 Constitutive laws for isotropic materials 55
they generate. The grips of the testing machine move slowly, applying an increasing load to the specimen. During the test, the extensional strain in the sample is computed by dividing the change in length of the test section by its original length, ≤1 = ∆`/`. The stress in the sample is computed by dividing the applied load by the sample cross-sectional area, σ1 = N/A. The results of the test are presented in the form of a stress-strain diagram: the strain is plotted along the abscissa, the stress along the ordinate.
2.1 Constitutive laws for isotropic materials
2.1.1 Homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic materials
For specimens undergoing small deformations, the stress-strain diagram often exhibits a linear behavior. Although this is a very crude approximation to the behavior of actual materials, it is a convenient assumption that is often used for preliminary evaluation. A linear relationship between stress and strain can be expressed as
σ1 = E ≤1, (2.1)
where the coefficient of proportionality, E, is called Young’s modulus or modulus of elasticity. Since strains are non-dimensional quantities, this coefficient has the same units as stress quantities, i.e., Pa. This linear relationship is known as Hooke’s law. The elongation of a bar in the direction of the applied stress is accompanied by a lateral contraction that is also proportional to the applied stress. The resulting deformations for this uniaxial state of stress can therefore be described by the following strains
≤1 = 1
E σ1, ≤2 = − ν
E σ1, ≤3 = − ν
E σ1, (2.2)
where ν is called Poisson’s ratio and is a non-dimensional constant. If a stress component, σ2, is applied to the same material, similar deformations will result
≤1 = − ν
E σ2, ≤2 = 1
E σ2, ≤3 = − ν
E σ2. (2.3)
Note that the assumption of material isotropy implies identical values of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio in eq. (2.2) and (2.3). Similar relationships hold for an applied stress, σ3.
Generalized Hooke’s law
When the three stress components are applied simultaneously, the resulting deformation is the sum of the deformations obtained for each stress component applied individually because of the assumed linear behavior of the material. This results in the generalized Hooke’s law for extensional strains


56 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
≤1 = 1
E [σ1 − ν(σ2 + σ3)] , (2.4a)
≤2 = 1
E [σ2 − ν(σ1 + σ3)] , (2.4b)
≤3 = 1
E [σ3 − ν(σ1 + σ2)] . (2.4c)
The extensional strains depend only on the direct stresses and not on the shear stresses. This is a key characteristic of isotropic materials, which does not hold for anisotropic materials.
Shear stress-shear strain relationships
The relationship between the shear strains and the shear stresses is bit more complicated to deduce, but it is revealed by the following reasoning. Consider the state of pure shear in a plane stress state described in section 1.3.5, which is characterized by two principal stresses that are equal and opposite in magnitude and with the third principal stress equal to zero. Assume that the principal stresses are σp2 = −σp1, σp3 = 0. The corresponding extensional strain components then follow from the generalized Hooke’s law eq. (2.4a) and (2.4b) while the shear strain must be zero in the principal axes
≤1 = 1 + ν
E σp1, ≤2 = − 1 + ν
E σp1, γ12 = 0. (2.5)
In the analysis of the pure shear stress state, the state of stress on faces oriented at a 45◦ angle with respect to the principal stress directions is shown to take on an extreme value given by
τs∗12 = σp2 = −σp1, σs∗1 = σs∗2 = 0 (2.6)
where the asterisk and subscript “s” are used to designate this special rotated axis system with maximum shear stresses. The strains in this rotated axis system are readily obtained from eq. (1.94), with θs = 45◦,
γs∗12 = −(≤1 − ≤2) = − 2(1 + ν)
E σp1; ≤s∗1 = ≤s∗2 = 0. (2.7)
The relationship between τs∗12 and γs∗12 is then obtained by comparing eq. (2.6) and
eq. (2.7) above to find γs∗12 = −2(1+ν)σp1/E = 2(1+ν)τs∗12/E, or τs∗12 = G γs∗12,
where
G= E
2(1 + ν) (2.8)
is defined as the shear modulus. The above reasoning can be repeated for a state of pure shear in the other two orthogonal planes leading to similar results for the other shear stresses and strains, and this can be summarized by the generalized Hooke’s law for shear strains


2.1 Constitutive laws for isotropic materials 57
γ23 = τ23/G, γ13 = τ13/G, γ12 = τ12/G. (2.9)
Here again, the shear modulus is the same in all directions due to the assumed isotropy of the material. The shear strain-shear stress relationships, eq. (2.9), are established for the case of pure shear. They remain valid, however, for more complex stress states involving axial stresses, because, in view of eq. (2.4), axial stresses create no shear strains. Similarly, the generalized Hooke’s law, eq. (2.4), is established when only axial stresses are applied. They do remain valid for more complex stress states involving shear stresses because, in view of eq. (2.9), shear stresses create no axial strains.
Matrix form of the constitutive laws
The constitutive laws, eqs. (2.4) and (2.9), are often called the generalized Hooke’s laws. They can be expressed in a compact matrix form as
≤ = S σ, (2.10)
where ≤ and σ are the strain and stress arrays, respectively, and store the six strain and stress components, respectively,
≤ = {≤1, ≤2, ≤3, γ23, γ13, γ12
}T , (2.11a)
σ = {σ1, σ2, σ3, τ23, τ13, τ12

The upper left 3 × 3 partition of the compliance matrix represents generalized Hooke’s law, eq. (2.4), whereas the lower right 3 × 3 partition represents the shear stress-shear strain relationships, eq. (2.9). The vanishing of the upper right and lower left partitions stems from the absence of coupling between axial stresses and shear strains, and shear stresses and axial strains, respectively. In summary, a homogeneous, linearly elastic, isotropic material is characterized by the constitutive laws given by eqs. (2.4) and (2.9) or combined as eq. (2.10). Only two material parameters are involved in these laws, Young’s modulus, E, and Poisson’s ratio, ν. The shear modulus G can be evaluated from eq. (2.8). The constitutive laws are often presented in the compliance form of eq. (2.10), i.e., strains are expressed as a function of stress. A straightforward algebraic process, however, yields the stiffness form of the same constitutive laws, where stresses are expressed as a function of strains,

Plane stress state
The state of plane stress is studied in section 1.3. It will be convenient to define stress and strain arrays that include only the relevant components of stress and strain,

}T , (2.15a)
σ = {σ1, σ2, τ12

For the plane strain case, ≤3 = γ13 = γ23 = 0, the stiffness matrix again reduces to a 3 × 3 matrix, but now different from eq. (2.16),

2.1 Constitutive laws for isotropic materials 59
The bulk modulus
The volumetric strain is readily evaluated with the help of eq. (1.75)
e = ≤1 + ≤2 + ≤3 = 1 − 2ν
E (σ1 + σ2 + σ3) = 1 − 2ν
E I1, (2.18)
where I1 is the first stress invariant defined by eq. (1.15a). In the special case of an applied hydrostatic pressure, σ1 = σ2 = σ3 = p, a linear relationship is found between the applied pressure and the resulting volumetric strain
p = κ e, (2.19)
where
κ= E
3(1 − 2ν) , (2.20)
is known is the bulk modulus of the material. When Poisson’s ratio approaches a value of 1/2, the bulk modulus approaches infinity, implying the vanishing of the volumetric strain under an applied pressure. Such a material is called an incompressible material. Many types of rubber materials are nearly incompressible, and metals undergoing plastic deformations are often assumed to be nearly incompressible.
2.1.2 Thermal effects
When a sample of a material is heated, its dimensions will change. Under a change in temperature, homogeneous isotropic materials will expand equally in all directions, generating thermal strains, ≤t = f (∆T ), where f (∆T ) is a function of the change in temperature ∆T . The volume of most materials increases when they are subjected to increased temperatures, whereas temperature decreases generally cause the material to shrink. There are, however, notable exceptions. For example, the transition from water to ice under decreasing temperature is accompanied by a volume increase. For moderate temperature changes, it is often adequate to assume that f (∆T ) is a linear function of the temperature change, i.e., f (∆T ) = α∆T , where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, a positive number if the material expands under increased temperature. The thermal strain now becomes
≤t = α∆T. (2.21)
Two important aspects of thermal deformations must be emphasized. First, thermal strains are purely extensional: temperature changes do not induce shear strains. Second, thermal strains do not generate internal stresses, in contrast with mechanical strains that are related to internal stresses through the material constitutive law. An unconfined material sample subjected to a temperature change simply expands, but remains unstressed. For homogeneous isotropic materials, the total strain is the sum of the thermal and mechanical strains. Thermal strains are the consequence of temperature changes,


60 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
whereas mechanical strains result from the application of stresses. The total strains are the superposition of the mechanical strains, given by eq. (2.4), and their thermal counterparts, given by eq. (2.21),
≤1 = 1
E [σ1 − ν(σ2 + σ3)] + α∆T ; (2.22a)
≤2 = 1
E [σ2 − ν(σ1 + σ3)] + α∆T ; (2.22b)
≤3 = 1
E [σ3 − ν(σ1 + σ2)] + α∆T. (2.22c)
Because temperature changes induce no shear strains, the shear stress-shear strain relationships given by eq. (2.9) remain unchanged. When dealing with constrained material samples, temperature changes will indirectly generate stresses in the material. For example, consider a bar constrained at its two ends by rigid walls that prevent any extension of the bar. When subjected to a temperature change, ∆T , the bar tries to expand in all directions, but the rigid walls prevent expansion of the bar along its axis, ı ̄1. The stress components in the transverse direction, σ2 and σ3, must vanish because the bar is free to expand in those directions, whereas the axial strain, ≤1, must vanish, due to the presence of the rigid walls. Eq. (2.22a) then implies
≤1 = 1
E [σ1] + α∆T = 0,
and hence, σ1 = −Eα∆T ; the temperature change induces a compressive stress in the bar. Such stresses are called thermal stresses. If same the bar is allowed to freely expand, i.e., if the end walls are removed, axial equilibrium of the bar implies σ1 = 0 and eq. (2.22a) then yields ≤1 = α∆T : the temperature change induces thermal strains, but no thermal stresses.
Example 2.1. Material sample confined in a rigid circular cylinder
Consider a sample of linearly elastic, isotropic material confined in an infinitely rigid circular cylinder and subjected to an applied stress σ3, as depicted in fig. 2.2. Because the circular cylinder cannot deform in the directions perpendicular to the applied stress direction, the corresponding strain components must vanish, ≤1 = ≤2 = 0. The first two equations of the generalized Hooke’s laws, eqs. (2.4a) and (2.4b), then yield σ1 = σ2 = ν/(1 − ν) σ3. Introducing these results into the last of the generalized Hooke’s laws, eq. (2.4c), leads to
≤3 = (1 + ν)(1 − 2ν)
E(1 − ν) σ3.
The apparent modulus of elasticity of the sample is defined as Ea = σ3/≤3, and
Ea = (1 − ν)
(1 + ν)(1 − 2ν) E.

As Poisson’s ratio approaches 1/2, the normalized apparent modulus of elasticity Ea/E increases rapidly, as shown in fig. 2.3. For ν = 0.45, Ea/E = 3.79, i.e., the apparent modulus of the sample is 3.79 times that of the material.
Example 2.2. State of strain at the outer surface of a body
An experimentalist has measured the state of strain, ≤1, ≤2, and γ12, at the outer surface of a three-dimensional body made of a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material. Axes ı ̄1 and ı ̄2 define the plane tangent to the outer surface of the body, and axis ı ̄3 is normal to this outer surface. Find the strain components ≤3, γ13 and γ23. Since the outer surface of the body is stress free, equilibrium requires σ3 = τ13 = τ23 = 0. Hooke’s law for shear components, see eq. (2.9), then readily implies that γ13 = γ23 = 0. The determination of the last strain component is more arduous. For this particular situation, generalized Hooke’s laws, eqs. (2.4), become
≤1 = 1
E [σ1 − νσ2] , ≤2 = 1
E [σ2 − νσ1] , ≤3 = 1
E [−ν(σ1 + σ2)] ,
since σ3 = 0. Adding together the first two equations yields ≤1 + ≤2 = (1 − ν)(σ1 + σ2)/E. Introducing this result in the last equation then yields
≤3 = − ν
1 − ν (≤1 + ≤2).
Typically, the three strain components at the outer surface of the body, ≤1, ≤2, and γ12, are measured with the help of strain gauges. The determination of the remaining strain components is based on the equilibrium conditions at the surface of the body and on the constitutive laws, in this case Hooke’s law.

2.1 Constitutive laws for isotropic materials 63
2.1.4 Ductile materials
The linearly elastic behavior described in the previous section is a highly idealized behavior. In general, materials will present a nonlinear relationship between stress and strain. Figure 2.5 shows a typical stress-strain diagram for a ductile material such as mild steel. From point O to point A, the material behaves in a linear manner, and this can be described by Hooke’s law. In this region, the slope of the stress-strain diagram is constant and its value equals Young’s modulus, E. If the loading is released, the specimen will come back to its original configuration without sustaining any permanent deformations, and it is referred to as being “elastic.” Beyond point A, the behavior is no longer proportional (linear), and hence, this point is called the limit of proportionality. The corresponding stress level is denoted σe, see fig. 2.5. The material may continue to be elastic beyond point A, but at some point it will begin to deform plastically, and when the load is removed, a permanent deformation will remain. The stress at which this occurs is called the yield stress, σy. More often than not, especially for mild steels, little difference exists between the limit of proportionality and the yield stress, and so σe and σy are often used interchangeably. Beyond point B, the material un

dergoes extensive deformation at a nearly constant stress level, denoted by σp. From point B to point C, the material is undergoing a plastic flow under nearly constant stress level. Figure 2.5 shows that the strain over this region amounts to about 5% (i.e., ≤1 = 0.05), but for highly ductile steels and other materials, this may amount to more than 10%. Beyond point C, an increasing stress level is required to continue deforming the material. The stress level increases up to point E, where the maximum stress level, denoted by σf , is reached. Past this point, the cross-sectional area of the specimen decreases significantly at a particular location along the test section: this phenomenon is called “necking” of the specimen. Because the stress level is determined by dividing the applied load by the original cross-sectional area, the stress level will seem to decrease beyond point E, but if the stress level is computed by dividing the applied load by the reduced cross-section area of the specimen at the location where necking occurs, this true stress level sill continue to increase past point E. With most experimental testing equipment, a controlled load (rather than a controlled deformation) is applied, and hence, point F is never recorded. Instead, once point E is reached, necking develops and the specimen breaks almost immediately afterwards. Consequently, the stress at point E is called the failure stress and desig

nated by σf . Only when controlled extension is applied to the specimen is it possible to follow the behavior of the specimen from point E to point F. Clearly, ductile materials undergo very large deformations before failure, corresponding to the portion of the stress-strain curve from point B to E in fig. 2.5. Experiments show that if the specimen is unloaded at a point between B and E, for example at point D, the stress-strain relationship will follow curve DG, parallel to AO, and while unloading, the material behaves elastically, although a permanent deformation of magnitude OG will remain after all loading is removed. If the specimen is reloaded, the stress-strain relationship will follow curve GD, and if additional loading is applied, it will follow curve DEF, as if the prior unloading had not taken place. The reloading curve GD is linear and reaches a higher stress level at point D before yield occurs and plastic deformation begins again. This increase in the yield stress is called strain hardening1. The discussion presented in the previous paragraphs is focused on diagrams of axial stress versus axial strain obtained from a tensile test as depicted in fig. 2.1. It is not unexpected that material behavior under shear exhibits nonlinear characteristics of a nature that is similar to that observed under tension. Figure 2.6 shows a typical shear stress-shear strain diagram for a ductile material such as mild steel. Here again, upon unloading, the material tends to behave in a linear manner, although a permanent deformation of magnitude OG will be remain after unloading.

Fig. 2.7. Stress-strain diagram for an elasticperfectly plastic material.
It is sometimes convenient to idealize the stress-strain diagram of ductile materials as presenting an initial elastic regime, followed by a perfectly plastic regime. This idealization is depicted in fig. 2.7. For a strain range −≤e ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤e, the material is linearly elastic, but for strain level outside this range, the material is perfectly plastic, that is, the material flows under a constant stress level, σe which is also the yield stress σy. This highly idealized material behavior is called elastic-perfectly
1 Strain hardening is particularly noticeable in annealed copper such as might be encountered in new copper tubing. After the tube is initially bent, it requires a considerably greater effort to begin bending again or to try to reverse the initial bend.

plastic material behavior. Failure occurs when the strain reaches the level ≤f . Such a constitutive model is a good first approximation to the behavior of a ductile metallic material such as mild steel or annealed aluminum. Of course, if the material is unloaded at point D, the unloading curve follows segment DG, parallel to OE. Other ductile materials such as aluminum and copper do not exhibit a plastic flow regime like the portion of the stress-strain diagram from point B to C in fig. 2.5 observed for mild steel. Figure 2.8 shows a representative stress-strain diagram for aluminum. For such materials, no pronounced limit of proportionality is present nor is the yield stress (elastic limit) evident. Instead, it is convenient to define the yield stress, denoted σy, as the stress level for which the specimen will exhibit a small permanent residual strain upon unloading. For aluminum, this residual strain is specified as 0.2% or ≤ = 0.002. The yield stress can be determined from the stress-strain diagram by constructing a straight line parallel to the initial linearly elastic portion of the curve at a 0.2% offset and recording the stress at the intersection with the stress-strain curve, as illustrated in fig. 2.8.
2.1.5 Brittle materials
Ductile materials are characterized by stress-strain diagrams such as those presented in figs. 2.5 and 2.8: large deformations occur when stress levels greater than that corresponding to the elastic limit of the material are applied. For brittle materials, very little deformation is observed beyond the elastic limit. Typically, failure occurs abruptly at strain levels much smaller than those observed for ductile materials. Figure 2.9 shows a stress-strain diagram typical of that observed for brittle materials such as glass, concrete, stone, wood, unidirectional composites or ceramic materials.

2.2 Allowable stress
A central problem of structural analysis is to determine the optimal configuration of a structure subjected to specific loads. The design will be influenced by many factors associated with various structural characteristics, such as those listed below.
1. The strength of the structure. When the local stress in the structure exceeds a specific value, the material will break or sustain permanent damage such as cracks or plastic deformations.
2. The elastic deformation of the structure under load. Even when subjected to small loads, a structure can present undesirable levels of elastic deformation. For example, the elastic deflection of a part may lead to interference with other parts in a structural assembly.
3. The dynamics characteristics of the structure. If the structure is subjected to dynamic loads, the time history of its response becomes important. More often than not, its natural frequencies must be carefully placed to avoid resonance. For aerospace structures, aeroelastic phenomena such as flutter will put stringent requirements on the torsional natural frequencies of wings and fuselages.
4. The stability characteristics of the structure. When parts of the structures are subjected to compressive loads, the equilibrium configuration can become unstable, resulting in buckling. During level flight, the upper skin of a wing of an aircraft is subjected to compressive loads. Wing design is significantly affected by buckling considerations.
5. The time dependent deformations of the structure associated with creep of the constitutive materials. Creep considerations play an important role in aircraft turbine engine design, because they are subjected to high temperatures.
The strength of a structure is the focus of the present section, although a good design must incorporate all the above characteristics. A structure is said to fail if it breaks, collapses, or develops significant permanent damage. Clearly, the applied service loads must be less, and often much less, than those corresponding to failure. The main reason for decreasing service loads is due to the numerous uncertainties about the problem. Among these are
1. The actual magnitude of the applied service loads is not accurately known. In an aircraft, maneuver loads or loads associated with a rough landing conditions cannot be precisely evaluated. Accidental overloads might also take place during flight or ground operations of the aircraft.
2. The strength of materials presents statistical characteristics. Measurements of the strengths of two nominally identical samples of aluminum will be different due to material inhomogeneities, processing difference, and experimental errors. 3. Manufacturing variability also plays an important role. For instance, machining fittings of complex shapes is a delicate operation. Dimensional tolerances might vary from part to part; the strength of the resulting material might not be equal to that measured in laboratory samples, and quality control sometimes fails to detect some types of defects in manufactured parts.


2.2 Allowable stress 67
4. The strength of the material might decrease in time due to corrosion, wear, or the presence of a chemically aggressive environment such as salt water, fuels or solvents. 5. Finally, if failure is predicted based on the computed value of internal stresses in the structure, these predicted stresses might be very different from their actual value, because simplifying assumptions are used to predict these stresses.
Consequently, service loads must be limited to a conservative level, and as the uncertainty about the problem increases, so must the level of conservatism in the design. It is common practice to account for all these uncertainties by defining a load factor
load factor = failure load
service load , (2.25) where failure load is the load at which the part fails and service load is the maximum load that is expected in normal service. Of course, the load factor should be larger than unity, and it is sometimes as large as 10. Engineering judgment must be carefully exercised in choosing this load factor. If a low value is selected, the likelihood of accidental failure will increase, whereas for high values, the design might be too expensive or too heavy for its intended purpose. The load factor might be viewed as a factor of safety with respect to failure: limiting the service loads to a fraction of the failure loads implies a safe operation of the structure. Using the load factor as a factor of safety is not always practical because the failure load is often unknown. Indeed, it is not practical, nor cost effective to test all structures to failure to determine the failure load. A more common approach is to compute the local stresses induced by the applied loads and limit the these local stresses to an allowable level. This can be written as
allowable stress = yield stress
safety factor , or σallow = σy
n , (2.26)
where σallow is the allowable stress, σy the yield stress of the material, and n the factor of safety. This definition is adequate for ductile materials described in section 2.1.4. Once the yield stress is reached, permanent deformation occurs. On the other hand, for brittle materials such as those discussed in section 2.1.5, the following definition of the allowable stress is more appropriate
allowable stress = ultimate stress
safety factor , or σallow = σf
n , (2.27)
where the ultimate stress is the failure stress for the material. In summary, the stress level, σ, that a structure is subjected to during service should be smaller than the allowable stress, leading to the following strength criterion
|σ| ≤ σallow. (2.28)
For some materials, the allowable stress in tension and in compression are different, and the actual stress level should then be compared to the appropriate allowable stress.


68 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
2.3 Yielding under combined loading
The concept of allowable stress discussed in the previous section is focused on the highly idealized case where a structural component is subjected to a single stress component. The yield criterion is then simply expressed in terms of the single stress component as σ ≤ σy. As depicted in fig. 1.3, a differential element of material can be subjected to a number of stress components simultaneously. The question is now: what is the proper yield criterion to be used when multiple stress components are acting simultaneously? Consider an aircraft propeller connected to a homogeneous, circular shaft. The engine applies a torque to the shaft resulting in shear stresses, τ , throughout the shaft. On the other hand, the propeller creates a thrust that generates uniform axial stresses, σ, over the cross-section. If the torque acts alone, the yield criterion is τ < τy; if the axial force acts alone, the corresponding criterion is σ < σy. In the actual structure, both stress components are acting simultaneously, and it is natural to ask: what is the proper criterion to apply? The yield criteria to be presented in this section are applicable to isotropic, homogeneous material subjected to a general three-dimensional state of stress. Because the material is isotropic, the direction of application of the stress is irrelevant. If the material is subjected to a single stress component, it should yield under the same stress level regardless of the direction in which this stress component is applied. In contrast, if the material is anisotropic, the direction of application of stress becomes important. For isotropic materials, there is no directional dependency of the yield criterion, even when subjected to a combined state of stress. An arbitrary state of stress can be represented by the six stress components defining the stress tensor at that point, for example, see eq. (1.3). Alternatively, the state of stress can be represented by the three principal stresses, σp1, σp2, and σp3 and the three orientations defining the faces on which these principal stresses act, see section 1.2.2. If the yield criterion should not depend on directional information because of material isotropy, it is clear that only the magnitudes of the principal stress should appear in its expression.
In addition, empirical evidence indicates that hydrostatic stress does not cause yielding. This implies that changes in the state of stress in which the three principal stresses are increased equally will not result in yielding. Other empirical evidence also suggests that yielding is directly related to the maximum shear stress in the material which, in turn, is directly proportional to the differences between the principal stresses. Two specific criteria will be presented here, Tresca’s criterion, see section 2.3.1, and von Mises’ criterion, see section 2.3.2. Both compute an equivalent maximum shear stress intensity but yield slightly different results for some cases. A more detailed discussion of yield criteria can be found in section 13.1.
2.3.1 Tresca’s criterion
Tresca’s yield criterion is expressed in terms of the following three principal stress inequalities


2.3 Yielding under combined loading 69
|σp1 − σp2| ≤ σy, |σp2 − σp3| ≤ σy, |σp3 − σp1| ≤ σy, (2.29)
where σy is the yield stress observed in a uniaxial test such as that described in fig. 2.5. The material operates in the linearly elastic range when the stress state it is subjected to satisfies the three inequalities expressed by eq. (2.29). Conversely, yielding develops whenever any one of these conditions is violated. Tresca’s criterion clearly meets the two conditions stated above: it depends only on the principal stresses, and a hydrostatic state of stress will not produce yielding. Tresca’s criterion can be interpreted in the following manner. Let ı ̄1∗, ı ̄2∗, and ı ̄3∗ be
the principal stress directions. Consider now a rotation of magnitude θ about axis ı ̄3∗.
The shear stress on this face inclined with respect to the principal stress directions is then given by eq. (1.49), where σ1 = σp1, σ2 = σp2 and τ12 = 0, to yield τ12 = −(σp1 − σp2)/2 sin 2θ. Clearly, the maximum shear stress is found on a face inclined at an angle θ = 45 degrees and gives τ12max = |σp1 − σp2|/2. Similar
arguments for rotations about axes ı ̄2∗ and ı ̄1∗ lead to τ13max = |σp1 − σp3|/2, and
τ23max = |σp2 − σp3|/2, respectively. Tresca’s criterion is now recast as τ23max ≤ σy/2, τ13max ≤ σy/2 and τ12max ≤ σy/2.
By denoting τmax = max (τ23max, τ13max, τ12max), Tresca’s criterion can be expressed by a single condition, τmax ≤ σy/2: the material reaches the yield condition when the maximum shear stress equals half the yield stress under a uniaxial stress state. This physical interpretation of Tresca’s criterion helps explain why it is sometimes called the maximum shear stress criterion. Tresca’s criterion is now applied to a few combined loading cases of practical interest.
Uniaxial stress state
First, consider the case of a material subjected to an uniaxial state of stress, σp1, σp2 = σp3 = 0. The sole non-vanishing principal stress is σp1, and Tresca’s yield criterion reduces to σp1 ≤ σy. This result is identical to the yield criterion discussed in section 2.2, as expected.
Plane state of stress
Consider a material under a plane state of stress, as defined in section 1.3. If σ1, σ2, and τ12 are the stress components in an arbitrary coordinate system, the principal stresses are readily found as
σp1, σp2 = σ1 + σ2
2±
√( σ1 − σ2 2
)2
+ τ122, σp3 = 0. (2.30)
Tresca’s criterion now implies the following three conditions

(2.31)


70 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
Pure shear state
The state of pure shear is a special case of a plane stress state where σ1 = σ2 = 0 and τ12 = τ . The only remaining condition of Tresca’s criterion, eq. (2.31), is τ ≤ σy/2. According to Tresca’s criterion, the shear stress level at which the material yields in a pure shear state is one half the level observed under uniaxial stress state.
2.3.2 Von Mises’ criterion
Von Mises’ yield criterion is expressed by the following inequality
σeq = √12
√
[(σp1 − σp2)2 + (σp2 − σp3)2 + (σp3 − σp1)2] ≤ σy, (2.32)
where the first equality defines the equivalent stress, σeq. Von Mises’ criterion states that the yield condition is reached under the combined loading, when the equivalent stress, σeq, reaches the yield stress for a uniaxial stress state, σy. Von Mises’ criterion clearly meets the requirement stated above: it only depends on the principal stresses and a hydrostatic state of stress will not produce yielding. The physical nature of this equivalent stress is better understood by considering the octahedral face discussed in example 1.3 on page 18. The magnitude of the shear stress acting on this octahedral face is given by eq. (1.25), and simple algebra then reveals
3τo2c = (σp21 + σp22 + σp23) − 1
3 (σp1 + σp2 + σp3)2 = 2
3 σe2q. (2.33)
This result implies that the equivalent stress is proportional the octahedral shear
stress: σeq = 3/√2 τoc. Von Mises’ criterion can now be restated as: the yield condition is reached under combined loading when the octahedral shear stress reaches
3/√2 of the yield stress for a uniaxial stress state, σy.
When applying von Mises’ criterion, the first step is to compute the equivalent stress defined by eq. (2.32). Given a loading state defined by the direct stress components σ1, σ2, and σ3 and shear stress components τ23, τ13, and τ12, it is necessary to first compute the principal stresses, σp1, σp2, and σp3 using the procedure described in section 1.2.2. This laborious procedure can be bypassed by noticing that the first two invariants of the stress tensor, see eq. (1.15a) and (1.15b), can be written as I1 = σp1 + σp2 + σp3 and I2 = σp1σp2 + σp2σp3 + σp3σp1, respectively, because the shear stresses vanish on the faces normal to the principal stress directions. The following algebraic manipulations show that the equivalent stress is readily expressed in terms of these two invariant as
σe2q = [(σp1 − σp2)2 + (σp2 − σp3)2 + (σp3 − σp1)2] /2
= (σp21 + σp22 + σp23) − (σp1σp2 + σp2σp3 + σp3σp1)
= (σp1 + σp2 + σp3)2 − 3(σp1σp2 + σp2σp3 + σp3σp1) = I12 − 3I2.
(2.34)


2.3 Yielding under combined loading 71
If the first two stress invariants are now expressed in terms of the stress components in an arbitrarily oriented axis system using eqs. (1.15a) and (1.15b), von Mises’ yield criterion can then be written as
σeq =
√
σ12 + σ22 + σ32 − σ2σ3 − σ3σ1 − σ1σ2 + 3(τ223 + τ123 + τ122) ≤ σy.
(2.35) This criterion is now applied to several combined loading cases of practical interest.
Uniaxial stress state
First, consider the case of a material subjected to an uniaxial state of stress, σp1, σp2 = σp3 = 0. The sole non-vanishing principal stress is σp1, and von Mises’s yield criterion reduces to σp1 ≤ σy. This result is identical to the yield criterion discussed in section 2.2, as expected.
Plane state of stress
Consider a material under a plane state of stress as defined in section 1.3. If σ1, σ2 and τ12 are the stress components in an arbitrary coordinate system, the equivalent stress, eq. (2.35), now reduces to
σeq =
√
σ12 + σ22 − σ1σ2 + 3τ122 ≤ σy. (2.36)
Pure shear state
The state of pure shear is a special case of plane stress where σ1 = σ2 = 0 and
τ12 = τ . Von Mises’ criterion, eq. (2.36), reduces to τ ≤ σy/√3. According to von Mises’ criterion, the shear stress level at which the material yields in a pure shear
state is 1/√3 ≈ 0.577, i.e., about 60% of the level observed under uniaxial stress state. Experimentation shows that this prediction is slightly more accurate than that of Tresca’s criterion. This and computational simplicity are the reasons why von Mises’ criterion is more widely used than Tresca’s.
2.3.3 Comparing Tresca’s and von Mises’ criteria
A useful geometric interpretation of Tresca’s and von Mises’ criteria can be obtained by considering a plane stress problem for which σp3 = 0. In the stress space of the two remaining principal stresses, σp1 and σp2, Tresca’s criterion, see eq. (2.29), reduce to three inequalities
| σp1
σy
| ≤ 1, | σp2
σy
| ≤ 1, | σp2
σy
− σp1
σy
| ≤ 1.
When taken as the limiting equalities, these three equations define the six straight line segments depicted in fig. 2.10. In the construction of this graph, the principal stresses


72 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
are normalized by the yield stress. Safe stress levels correspond to stress states falling within the irregular hexagon enclosed by the six dashed line segments. For this plane stress state, the yield envelope is therefore the hexagon shown in dashed lines in fig. 2.10. For the same stress states, von Mises’

criterion, see eq. (2.32), becomes the oblique ellipse defined by

Safe stress levels correspond to stress states falling within the ellipse shown in fig. 2.10 which forms the yield envelope. At the six vertices of the hexagon, the yield conditions predicted by the two criteria are identical. For all other stress conditions, Tresca’s criterion is slightly more conservative. In most experimental studies, yielding is observed to occur at points falling between these two criteria. As a purely practical matter, von Mises’criterion is often preferred because of its relatively simpler representation as a single analytical expression in contrast with the three separate inequalities that must be evaluated for Tresca’s criterion. When a set of loads is applied to a structure, it is natural to assume that they are all increased proportionally. Consequently, the components of the stress state, and therefore the principal stresses, increase proportionally as well. Three special stress states will be contrasted. In all three cases, the principal stresses are assumed to remain proportional as the load is applied, and hence, a single stress parameter, denoted σ, will be used to describe the loading for each case. The three stress cases are: (1) σp1 = −σp2 = σ, (2) σp1 = 2σp2 = σ, and (3) σp2 = 2σp1 = σ, and these correspond to the three radial lines OA, OB, and OC, respectively, shown in fig. 2.10. Table 2.1 shows a quantitative comparison of the cases. These three loading cases give the maximum discrepancy in the predictions of the two criteria. For all other loading configurations, the prediction differ by less than 15%.

Problem 2.7. Yield criterion for a confined cylindrical sample
Consider a sample of homogeneous, isotropic material of Poisson’s ratio ν and yield stress σy confined in a rigid cylinder, as depicted in fig. 2.2. A single stress component is applied to the material and it is assumed that there is no friction between the sample and the enclosure. (1) Find the stress level σ3 for which the sample will yield as a function of σy and ν if the material obeys Tresca’s criterion. Plot your results. (2) Find the stress level σ3 for which the sample will yield as a function of σy and ν if the material obeys von Mises’ criterion. Plot your results. Use a range of Poisson’s ratios ν ∈ [0, 0.5].
Problem 2.8. Yield criterion for a pressure vessel
A cylindrical pressure vessel of radius R and thickness t is subjected to an internal pressure pi, as shown in fig. 1.20. At any point in the cylindrical portion of vessel wall, two stress components are acting: the hoop stress, σh = Rpi/t and the axial stress, σa = Rpi/(2t). The radial stress, acting in the direction perpendicular to the wall, is very small, σr ≈ 0. The yield stress for the material is σy. (1) If the material is assumed to follow von Mises’ criterion, find the maximum internal pressure the vessel can carry. (2) If the material is assumed to follow Tresca’s criterion, find the maximum internal pressure the vessel can carry.
2.4 Material selection for structural performance
An important phase of structural design is the selection of a specific material. Table 2.2 lists the physical properties of three commonly used metals: aluminum, titanium, and steel. This table lists their respective ultimate stress, modulus of elasticity, and density. Table 2.3 lists the corresponding properties for a number of fibers. Table 2.2 shows that the ultimate stress and modulus of elasticity of steel are far superior to those of titanium or aluminum. Why then is steel not always preferred, since it is far stronger and stiffer? A second look at table 2.2 shows that while steel is far stronger and stiffer, it is also far heavier that the other two metals. In a weight sensitive design, a compromise must be made between these conflicting characteristics. The same observations can be made when comparing the properties of fibers, as listed in table 2.3. It is important to compare the performance of these various materials for specific structural applications. Three categories of structural design situations will be investigated, namely strength design, stiffness design, and buckling design. A performance index of the material will be derived in each case.

Consider a sheet of material of length L, width b, and thickness t, subjected to a tension load P , as depicted in the left portion of fig. 2.11.

The desired material performance index for strength design is σult/ρ, and it is proportional to the maximum load that can be carried by a structure of given geometry and mass.
2.4.2 Stiffness design
In many instances, the stiffness of a structure is specified, but more often than not, it is the natural frequency of the structure that must be maximized. Consider the cantilevered, thin-walled beam of length L consisting of two thin skins of width b

where H2c2 is the bending stiffness, and m the mass per unit span of the beam; these
quantities are readily found as H2c2 = Ebth2/2[1 + 1/3(t/h)2] and m = 2ρbt,
respectively. For a thin-walled structure t/h ø 1, and the natural frequency becomes

For a given configuration of the structure, h and L are given quantities, and the de
sired material performance index for stiffness design is √E/ρ, and it is proportional to the natural frequency of a structure of a given geometry and mass.
2.4.3 Buckling design
The right portion of fig. 2.11 shows a thin plate of length L, width b, and thickness t. The plate is supported around all its edges, and subjected to an in-plane compressive load P . The critical value of the load that will cause the plate to buckle is
Pcr ∝ Et3

This formula will be derived in section 16.7. The total mass of the structure is M = ρ btL; eliminating the thickness of the plate from then yields
Pcr ∝ M 3

ρ3 . (2.42)
For a given mass and geometry of the structure, the desired performance index is E/ρ3, and it is proportional to the maximum compressive load that can be carried by a structure of given geometry and mass.
Table 2.4 lists the performance indices σult/ρ, √E/ρ, and E/ρ3 for strength, stiffness, and buckling designs, respectively. Table 2.5 lists the corresponding quantities for a few fibers. Consider first the data of table 2.4. Steel is clearly the best material for strength design. When it comes to stiffness design, however, the three metals perform about equally well, with only a slight disadvantage for titanium. Finally, comparing the strength and buckling designs, the ranking of the materials is now reversed: aluminum performs far better than steel and titanium in buckling design. The same observations can be made about the fibers for which data is listed in table 2.5. In a strength design, S-glass out performs the other fibers. The situation is reversed for stiffness and buckling designs. It is clear that the third power of the


76 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
density in the denominator of the buckling design performance index makes lighter materials perform well in buckling sensitive designs. It is not possible to directly compare the materials in tables 2.4 and 2.5. Indeed, the various metals can be used as structural materials, whereas the fibers cannot be used, as such, as structural materials. It is clear, however, that the remarkably high performance indices of these fibers justifies a closer look at their potential use in structural applications.

2.5 Composite materials
2.5.1 Basic characteristics
Advanced composite materials for structural applications are made by embedding in a matrix material fibers that are all aligned in a single direction. A number of polymeric materials can be used as matrix materials. Thermoset materials such as epoxy have been extensively used as matrices for composite materials. The mechanical properties of epoxy are

2.5 Composite materials 77
A very crude way of approximating the strength of a composite material consisting of fibers all aligned in a single direction embedded in a matrix is to use a rule of mixture
Sc = Vf Sf + VmSm, (2.45)
where Sc, Sf , and Sm are the strength of the composite, fiber, and matrix materials, respectively; and Vf and Vm the volume fractions of fiber, and matrix materials, respectively. If the material contains no voids Vf + Vm = 1. Consider a composite material consisting of graphite fibers (Vf = 0.6), embedded in an epoxy matrix (Vm = 0.4). The strength of the composite can be estimated using eq. (2.45) and the data of table 2.3
Sc = 1700 × 0.6 + 50 × 0.4 = 1020 + 20 = 1040 MPa. (2.46)
Clearly, the matrix material contributes very little to the strength of the composite. The stiffness of the composite can also be crudely estimated from the following reasoning. Assume the various phases of the material to be perfectly bonded together,
≤m = ≤f = ≤c, (2.47)
where ≤m, ≤f , and ≤c are the strains in the matrix, fiber, and composite materials, respectively. If a sheet of this material is subjected to a tensile load P , the average stress in the composite, σc, can be defined as follows
P = Acσc = Af σf + Amσm, (2.48)
where σf and σm are the stresses in the fiber and matrix materials, respectively, and Ac, Af , and Am are the cross-sectional areas of composite, fiber, and matrix materials, respectively. Dividing eq. (2.48) by Ac yields
σc = Af
Ac
σf + Am
Ac
σm = Vf σf + Vmσm. (2.49)
If both fiber and matrix materials are assumed to be linearly elastic, isotropic materials, the following constitutive laws adequately describe their behavior
σf = Ef ≤f , σm = Em≤m, (2.50)
where Ef and Em are the moduli of elasticity for the fiber and matrix materials, respectively. Similarly, the modulus of elasticity Ec for the composite is defined as
σc = Ec≤c. (2.51)
Introducing eqs. (2.50) and (2.51) into eq. (2.49), and taking into account the assumed equality of the strain in the various materials, eq. (2.47), yields
Ec = Vf Ef + VmEm. (2.52)
For the graphite epoxy material considered above, the composite modulus of elasticity can be estimated as


78 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
Ec = 250 × 0.6 + 3.5 × 0.4 = 150 + 1.4 ≈ 150 GPa. (2.53)
Here again, the intrinsic stiffness of the matrix material contributes little to the stiffness of the composite. The above discussion clearly shows that a significant fraction of the high strength and stiffness of the fibers is directly inherited by the composite. The matrix material, however, contributes little to the strength and stiffness of the composite. This observation prompts the following question: what is the role of the matrix material in a composite? The matrix is needed to keep all the fibers together, and to provide an adequate surface finish. A less obvious role of the matrix is to diffuse the stresses among the otherwise isolated fibers. This aspect is explored in the next section.
2.5.2 Stress diffusion in composites
Consider a lamina consisting of fibers all aligned in a single direction embedded in a matrix material. The lamina is subjected to a far-field stress, σ0. If all the fibers are continuous, it is easy to see how the entire load will be carried by the fibers only, with no significant contribution of the matrix. In practical situations, however, numerous broken fibers will be present in the lamina.

Fig. 2.13. Stress diffusion problem.
Figure 2.12 shows the geometry of the problem, including a single broken fiber of length 2L. At the two ends of the fiber, the stress in the fiber must vanish. Nevertheless, the matrix material adjacent to the broken fiber will transfer stress from the surrounding material to the broken fiber. This stress diffusion process is a very important phenomenon because it allows all fibers, including broken fibers, to carry the applied load. A simplified model of this phenomenon is depicted in the cross-section shown in fig. 2.13. It consists of a cylindrical fiber of radius rf , surrounded by circular sleeve of matrix material of outer radius rm, itself surrounded by a circular sleeve of composite material of outer radius ra. The following assumptions will be made. (1) The matrix material carries shear stresses only. This assumption can be justified by


2.5 Composite materials 79
the fact that the stiffness of the fiber is far greater than that of the matrix, and hence, the axial stress it carries is far greater than that carried by the matrix. (2) The axial stress in the fiber is uniformly distributed over its cross-section. (3) The properties of the composite material surrounding the core fiber/matrix cylinder can smeared, i.e., the existence of individual fibers can be ignored, except for the specific broken fiber at the heart of the model. (4) The various phases of the model are perfectly bonded together. Due to the symmetry of the problem, the displacements at x1 = 0 are set to zero. Figure 2.14 shows the displacements uf (x1), and ua(x1) of the fiber, and composite, respectively, at section A-A in fig. 2.13. The stress-displacement relationships for the various constituents of the model are

where σf (x1) is the uniform axial stress in the fiber, and τm(x1) the shear stress in the matrix. On the other hand, the free body diagram of the entire model depicted in fig. 2.13 yields an overall equilibrium equation

It is clear that the fiber has a much smaller radius than the overall composite, i.e., rf /ra ø 1, and the second term of this equation become negligible. Furthermore,
rm/ra ø 1, i.e., 1 − (rm/ra)2 ≈ 1.


80 2 Constitutive behavior of materials
If Ef , Ea, and Gm are the moduli of elasticity of the fiber, and composite, and the shearing modulus of the matrix, respectively, the constitutive laws for the various constituents of the model are
σf = Ef ≤f , (2.57a) σa = Ea≤a, (2.57b) τm = Gmγm. (2.57c)
Introducing the matrix material constitutive law, eq. (2.57c), and the definition of the shear strain, eq. (2.54c), into the fiber equilibrium, eq. (2.55), yields
dσf dx1
+ 2Gm
rf (rm − rf ) (ua − uf ) = 0.
Taking a derivative of this equation with respect to x1, introducing the definition of the fiber and composite strains, eqs. (2.54a) and (2.54b), respectively, and using the constitutive laws, eqs. (2.57a) and (2.57b) leads to

Finally, the stress in the composite, σa, is eliminated by means of the overall equilibrium eq. (2.56) to find the governing equation for the fiber stress

As shown in fig. 2.13, the non-dimensional variable η = (L − x1)/(2rf ) measures the distance from the fiber break divided by the fiber diameter. The governing equation for the fiber stress becomes
σ′f′ − λ2σf = −λ2 Ef

where the notation (.)′ is used to denote a derivative with respect to η; and λ2 = 8(Gm/Ef )(rf /rm)/(1 − rf /rm). The volume fraction of the material is Vf =
(πrf2)/(πr2m) = (rf /rm)2. Furthermore, the rule of mixture for the modulus of elas
ticity, eq. (2.52), yields Ef /Ea = Ef /(Vf Ef + VmEm) ≈ Ef /(Vf Ef ) = 1/Vf , where the fact that Em ø Ef is taken into account. The governing equation finally can be recast as

The boundary conditions are σf = 0 at the broken end of the fiber, i.e., at η = 0.
At η = L/2rf , the symmetry of the problem requires σ′f = 0. The solution of
eq. (2.58) subjected to these boundary conditions is
