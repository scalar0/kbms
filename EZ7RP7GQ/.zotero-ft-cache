Foreword
The present book is meant as a text for a course on complex analysis at the advanced undergraduate level, or first-year graduate level. The first half, more or less, can be used for a one-semester course addressed to undergraduates. The second half can be used for a second semester, at either level. Somewhat more material has been included than can be covered at leisure in one or two terms, to give opportunities for the instructor to exercise individual taste, and to lead the course in whatever directions strikes the instructor's fancy at the time as well as extra reading material for students on their own. A large number of routine exercises are included for the more standard portions, and a few harder exercises of striking theoretical interest are also included, but may be omitted in courses addressed to less advanced students. In some sense, I think the classical German prewar texts were the best (Hurwitz-Courant, Knopp, Bieberbach, etc.) and I would recommend to anyone to look through them. More recent texts have emphasized connections with real analysis, which is important, but at the cost of exhibiting succinctly and clearly what is peculiar about complex analysis: the power series expansion, the uniqueness of analytic continuation, and the calculus of residues. The systematic elementary development of formal and convergent power series was standard fare in the German texts, but only Cartan, in the more recent books, includes this material, which I think is quite essential, e.g., for differential equations. I have written a short text, exhibiting these features, making it applicable to a wide variety of tastes. The book essentially decomposes into two parts. The first part, Chapters I through VIII, includes the basic properties of analytic functions, essentially what cannot be left out of, say, a onesemester course.
v


VI FOREWORD
I have no fixed idea about the manner in which Cauchy's theorem is to be treated. In less advanced classes, or if time is lacking, the usual hand waving about simple closed curves and interiors is not entirely inappropriate. Perhaps better would be to state precisely the homological version and omit the formal proof. For those who want a more thorough understanding, I include the relevant material. Artin originally had the idea of basing the homology needed for complex variables on the winding number. I have included his proof for Cauchy's theorem, extracting, however, a purely topological lemma of independent interest, not made explicit in Artin's original Notre Dame notes [Ar 65] or in Ahlfors' book closely following Artin [Ah 66]. I have also included the more recent proof by Dixon, which uses the winding number, but replaces the topological lemma by greater use of elementary properties of analytic functions which can be derived directly from the local theorem. The two aspects, homotopy and homology, both enter in an essential fashion for different applications of analytic functions, and neither is slighted at the expense of the other. Most expositions usually include some of the global geometric properties of analytic maps at an early stage. I chose to make the preliminaries on complex functions as short as possible to get quickly into the analytic part of complex function theory: power series expansions and Cauchy's theorem. The advantages of doing this, reaching the heart of the subject rapidly, are obvious. The cost is that certain elementary global geometric considerations are thus omitted from Chapter I, for instance, to reappear later in connection with analytic isomorphisms (Conformal Mappings, Chapter VII) and potential theory (Harmonic Functions, Chapter VIII). I think it is best for the coherence of the book to have covered in one sweep the basic analytic material before dealing with these more geometric global topics. Since the proof of the general Riemann mapping theorem is somewhat more difficult than the study of the specific cases considered in Chapter VII, it has been postponed to the second part. The second and third parts of the book, Chapters IX through XVI, deal with further assorted analytic aspects of. functions in many directions, which may lead to many other branches of analysis. I have emphasized the possibility of defining analytic functions by an integral involving a parameter and differentiating under the integral sign. Some classical functions are given to work out as exercises, but the gamma functjon is worked out in detail in the text, as a prototype. The chapters in Part II allow considerable flexibility in the order they are covered. For instance, the chapter on analytic continuation, including the Schwarz reflection principle, and/or the proof of the Riemann mapping theorem could be done right after Chapter VII, and still achieve great coherence. As most of this part is somewhat harder than the first part, it can easily be omitted from a one-term course addressed to undergraduates. In the


FOREWORD Vll
same spirit, some of the harder exercises in the first part have been starred, to make their omission easy.
Comments on the Third and Fourth Editions
I have rewritten some sections and have added a number of exercises. I have added some material on harmonic functions and conformal maps, on the Borel theorem and Borel's proof of Picard's theorem, as well as D.J. Newman's short proof of the prime number theorem, which illustrates many aspects of complex analysis in a classical setting. I have made more complete the treatment of the gamma and zeta functions. I have also added an Appendix which covers some topics which I find sufficiently important to have in the book. The first part of the Appendix recalls summation by parts and its application to uniform convergence. The others cover material which is not usually included in standard texts on complex analysis: difference equations, analytic differential equations, fixed points of fractional linear maps (of importance in dynamical systems), Cauchy's formula for COC! functions, and Cauchy's theorem for locally integrable vector fields in the plane. This material gives additional insight on techniques and results applied to more standard topics in the text. Some of them may have been assigned as exercises, and I hope students will try to prove them before looking up the proofs in the Appendix. I am very grateful to several people for pointing out the need for a number of corrections, especially Keith Conrad, Wolfgang Fluch, Alberto Grunbaum, Bert Hochwald, Michal Jastrzebski, Jose Carlos Santos, Ernest C. Schlesinger, A. Vijayakumar, Barnet Weinstock, and Sandy Zabell. Finally, I thank Rami Shakarchi for working out an answer book.

Prerequisites
We assume that the reader has had two years of calculus, and has some acquaintance with epsilon-delta techniques. For convenience, we have recalled all the necessary lemmas we need for continuous functions on compact sets in the plane. Section §1 in the Appendix also provides some background. We use what is now standard terminology. A function
f: S-+ T
is called injective if x =1= y in S implies f(x) =1= f(y). It is called surjective if for every z in T there exists XES such that f(x) = z. If f is surjective, then we also say that f maps S onto T. If f is both injective and surjective then we say that f is bijective.
Given two functions f, 9 defined on a set of real numbers containing arbitrarily large numbers, and such that g(x) ~ 0, we write
f~g or f(x) ~ g(x) for x -+ 00
to mean that there exists a number C > 0 such that for all x sufficiently large, we have
If(x) I ~ Cg(x).
Similarly, if the functions are defined for x near 0, we use the same symbol ~ for x -+ 0 to mean that there exists C > 0 such that
If(x) I ~ Cg(x)
ix


x PREREQUISITES
for all x sufficiently small (there exists b > 0 such that if Ixl < b then If(x)1 ~ Cg(x)). Often this relation is also expressed by writing
f(x) = O(g(x)),
which is read: f(x) is big oh of g(x), for x - 00 or x - 0 as the case may be. We use ]a, b[ to denote the open interval of numbers
a < x < b.
Similarly, [a, b[ denotes the half-open interval, etc.

Complex Numbers
and Functions
One of the advantages of dealing with the real numbers instead of the rational numbers is that certain equations which do not have any solutions in the rational numbers have a solution in real numbers. For instance, x 2 = 2 is such an equation. However, we also know some
equations having no solution in real numbers, for instance x2 = -1, or x 2 = - 2. We define a new kind of number where such equations have solutions. The new kind of numbers will be called complex numbers.
I, §1. DEFINITION
The complex numbers are a set of objects which can be added and multiplied, the sum and product of two complex numbers being also a complex number, and satisfy the following conditions.
1. Every real number is a complex number, and if oc, p are real numbers, then their sum and product as complex numbers are the same as their sum and product as real numbers. 2. There is a complex number denoted by i such that i2 = -1. 3. Every complex number can be written uniquely in the form a + bi where a, b are real numbers. 4. The ordinary laws of arithmetic concerning addition and multiplication are satisfied. We list these laws:
If oc, p, yare complex numbers, then (ocP)y = oc(Py), and
(oc + f3) + y = oc + (P + y).

4 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS
We have a(p + y) = afJ + ay, and (fJ + y)a = fJrx + yrx.
We have rxfJ = fJrx, and rx + fJ = fJ + rx.
If 1 is the real number one, then la = a.
If 0 is the real number zero, then Oa = O.
We have rx + (-1)a = O.
[I, §1]
We shall now draw consequences of these properties. With each complex number a + bi, we associate the point (a, b) in the plane. Let
rx := al + azi and fJ = bl + b2 i be two complex numbers. Then
Hence addition of complex numbers is carried out "componentwise". For example, (2 + 3i) + (-1 + 5i) = 1 + 8i.

(0, I) =i -----..,IIIII

a
In multiplying complex numbers, we use the rule iZ = - 1 to simplify
a product and to put it in the form a + bi. For instance, let rx = 2 + 3i and fJ = 1 - i. Then
rxfJ = (2 + 3i)(1 - i) = 2(1 - i) + 3i(1 - i)
= 2 - 2i + 3i - 3i2
= 2 + i - 3( -1)
=2+3+i
= 5 + i.
Let rx = a + bi be a complex number. We define Ii to be a - bi.
Thus if a. :::: 2 + 3i, then Ii = 2 - 3i. The complex number Ii is called the


[I, §1] DEFINITION 5
conjugate of 0:. We see at once that
With the vector interpretation of complex numbers, we see that o:ii is the square of the distance of the point (a, b) from the origin. We now have one more important property of complex numbers, which will allow us to divide by complex numbers other than O. If 0: = a + bi is a complex number =F 0, and if we let
then o:l = lo: = 1. The proof of this property is an immediate consequence of the law of multiplication of complex numbers, because
The number A. above is called the inverse of 0:, and is denoted by 0:-1 or 1/0:. If 0:, fJ are complex numbers, we often write fJ/o: instead of (1.-1fJ (or fJo:- 1), just as we did with real numbers. We see that we can divide by complex numbers =F O.
Example. To find the inverse of (1 + i) we note that the conjugate
of 1 + i is 1 - i and that (1 + i)(1 - i) = 2. Hence
1- i
(1 + ifl = -2-'
Theorem 1.1. Let 0:, fJ be complex numbers. Then
ii = ex.
Proof The proofs follow immediately from the definitions of addition, multiplication, and the complex conjugate. We leave them as exercises (Exercises 3 and 4).
Let ex = a + bi be a complex number, where a, b are real. We shall call a the real part of 0:, and denote it by Re(ex). Thus
0: + ii = 2a = 2 Re(ex).

The real number b is called the imaginary part of a, and denoted by Im(a). We define the absolute value of a complex number a = al + ia2 (where aI' az are real) to be
lal = Jai + a~.
If we think of a as a point in the plane (aI, a2), then lal is the length of the line segment from the origin to a. In terms of the absolute value, we can write
provided a :/= O. Indeed, we observe that lal2 = aa.

Theorem 1.2. The absolute value of a complex number satisfies the
following properties. If a, Pare complex numbers, then

Proof We have


[I, §1] DEFINITION 7
Taking the square root, we conclude that lailPI = laPI, thus proving the first assertion. As for the second, we have
la + PI2= (a + p)(a + p) = (a + P)(~ + P)
= a~ + P~ + ap + pp
= lal2+ 2Re(p~) + IPI2
because ap = pa;. However, we have
2Re(p~) ~ 21P~1
because the real part of a complex number is ~ its absolute value. Hence
la + PI2~ lal2+ 21P~1 + IPI2
~ lal2+ 21Pllal + IPI2
= (Ial + IPI)2.
Taking the square root yields the second assertion of the theorem.
The inequality
la + PI ~ lal + IPI
is called the triangle inequality. It also applies to a sum of several terms. If Zl' ••. ,Zn are complex numbers then we have

Let (x, y) = x + iy be a complex number. We know that any point in the plane can be represented by polar coordinates (r,O). We shall now see how to write our complex number in terms of such polar coordinates. Let () be a real number. We define the expression eilJ to be
ei6 = cos 0 + i sin O.
Thus ei6 is a complex number.


[I, §2] POLAR FORM 9
For example, if e= n, then ei1! = -1. Also, e21!i = 1, and ei1!/2 = i.
Furthermore, ei(8+21!) = ei6 for any real e.
rei' = x + iy
y = r sin 8
x=rcos8
Figure 3
Let x, y be real numbers and x + iy a complex number. Let
If (r, e) are the polar coordinates of the point (x, y) in the plane, then
x = r cos e and y = r sin e.
Hence
x + iy = r cos e + ir sin e = re i6•
The expression re i6 is called the polar form of the complex number x + iy. The number e is sometimes called the angle, or argument of z, and we write e = arg z.
The most important property of this polar form is given in Theorem 2.1. It will allow us to have a very good geometric interpretation for the product of two complex numbers.
Theorem 2.1. Let e, cp be two real numbers. Then
Proof By definition, we have
ei8+iqJ = ei(8+qJ) = cos(e + cp) + i sin(e + cp).


10 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS [I, §2]
Using the addition formulas for sine and cosine, we see that the preceding expression is equal to
cos 0 cos cp - sin 0 sin cp + i(sin 0 cos cp + sin cp cos 0).
This is exactly the same expression as the one we obtain by multiplying out (cos 0 + i sin O)(cos cp + i sin cp).
Our theorem is proved.
Theorem 2.1 justifies our notation, by showing that the exponential of complex numbers satisfies the same formal rule as the exponential of real numbers. Let 0( = ai + ia2 be a complex number. We define e" to be
For instance, let 0( = 2 + 3i. Then e" = e2e3i•
Theorem 2.2. Let 0(, Pbe complex numbers. Then
Proof. Let 0( = ai + ia2 and P= hi + ib2 • Then
Using Theorem 2.1, we see that this last expression is equal to
By definition, this is equal to e"efJ, thereby proving our theorem.
Theorem 2.2 is very useful in dealing with complex numbers. We shall now consider several examples to illustrate it.
Example 1. Find a complex number whose square is 4eilt/2•
Let z = 2e ilt/4 • Using the rule for exponentials, we see that Z2 = 4e ilt/2•
Example 2. Let n be a positive integer. Find a complex number w such that w" = eilt/2•


[I, §2] POLAR FORM 11
It is clear that the complex number w = ei1t/Zn satisfies our requirement. In other words, we may express Theorem 2.2 as follows;
Let Zl = r 1ei6 , and Zz = rzei62 be two complex numbers. To find the product ZlZz, we multiply the absolute values and add the angles. Thus
In many cases, this way of visualizing the product of complex numbers is more useful than that coming out of the definition.
Warning. We have not touched on the logarithm. As in calculus, we want to say that eZ = w if and only if z = log w. Since e21tik = I for all integers k, it follows that the inverse function Z = log w is defined only up to the addition of an integer multiple of 2ni. We shall study the logarithm more closely in Chapter II, §3, Chapter II, §5, and Chapter III, §6.

Expand both sides and make cancellations to simplify the problem.)
I, §3. COMPLEX VALUED FUNCTIONS
Let S be a set of complex numbers. An association which to each element of S associates a complex number is called a complex valued function, or a function for short. We denote such a function by symbols like
f: S .... c.


[I, §3] COMPLEX VALUED FUNCTIONS 13
If z is an element of S, we write the association of the value J(z) to z by the special arrow
ZH J(z).
We can write
J(z) = u(z) + iv(z),
where u(z) and v(z) are real numbers, and thus
ZHU(Z), ZHv(Z)
are real valued functions. We call u the real part of J, and v the imagi
nary part of f.
We shall usually write
z = x + iy,
where x, yare real. Then the values of the function J can be written in the form
J(z) = J(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),
viewing u, v as functions of the two real variables x and y.
Example. For the function
J(z) = x 3y + i sin(x + y),
we have the real part,
and the imaginary part,
v(x, y) = sin(x + y).
Example. The most important examples of complex functions are the power functions. Let n be a positive integer. Let
Then in polar coordinates, we can write z = re i6, and therefore
For this function, the real part is rn cos nO, and the imaginary part is r" sin nO.

Let 15 be the closed disc of radius 1 centered at the origin in C. In other words, 15 is the set of complex numbers z such that Izl ~ 1. If z is an element of 15, then z" is also an element of 15, and so zH z" maps 15 into itself. Let S be the sector of complex numbers re i8 such that

as shown on Fig. 4.
Figure 4
The function of a real variable
rHr"
maps the unit interval [0, 1] onto itself. The function
()H n()
maps the interval
[0, 2n/n] --+ [0, 2nJ.
In this way, we see that the function J(z) = z" maps the sector S onto the full disc of all numbers
with °~ t ~ 1 and °~ cp ~ 2n. We may say that the power function
wraps the sector around the disc. We could give a similar argument with other sectors of angle 2n/n


[I, §3] COMPLEX VALUED FUNCTIONS 15
as shown on Fig. 5. Thus we see that z H zn wraps the disc n times around.

Each complex number

The points Wi are just the product of ei8/n with all the n-th roots of unity,
One of the major results of the theory of complex variables is to reduce the study of certain functions, including most of the common functions you can think of (like exponentials, logs, sine, cosine) to power series, which can be approximated by polynomials. Thus the power function is in some sense the unique basic function out of which the others are constructed. For this reason it was essential to get a good intuition of the power function. We postpone discussing the geometric aspects of the other functions to Chapters VII and VIII, except for some simple exercises.

Let rx be a complex number. By the open disc of radius r > 0 centered at rx we mean the set of complex numbers z such that
Iz - rxl < r.
For the closed disc, we use the condition Iz - rxl :;£ r instead. We shall deal only with the open disc unless otherwise specified, and thus speak simply of the disc, denoted by D(rx, r). The closed disc is denoted by D(rx, r).
Let V be a subset of the complex plane. We say that V is open if for every point rx in V there is a disc D(rx, r) centered at rx, and of some radius r > 0 such that this disc D(rx, r) is contained in U. We have illustrated an open set in Fig. 8.

Figure 9
On the other hand, the set consisting of the first quadrant and the vertical and horizontal axes as on Fig. 9(b) is not open. The upper half plane by definition is the set of complex numbers
z = x + iy
with y > O. It is an open set. Let S be a subset of the plane. A boundary point of S is a point ~ such that every disc D(~, r) centered at ~ and of radius r > 0 contains both points of S and points not in S. In the closed first quadrant of Fig. 9(b), the points on the x-axis with x ~ 0 and on the y-axis with y ~ 0 are boundary points of the quadrant. A point ~ is said to be adherent to S if every disc D(~, r) with r > 0 contains some element of S. Apoint ~ is said to be an interior point of S if there exists a disc D(~, r) which is contained in S. Thus an adherent point can be a boundary point or an interior point of S. A set is called


[I, §4] LIMITS AND COMPACT SETS 19
closed if it contains all its boundary points. The complement of a closed set is then open. The closure of a set S is defined to be the union of S and all its boundary points. We denote the closure by S. A set S is said to be bounded if there exists a number C > 0 such that
Izl ~ C for all z in S.
For instance, the set in Fig. 10 is bounded. The first quadrant is not bounded.
Figure 10
The upper half plane is not bounded. The condition for boundedness means that the set is contained in the closed disc of radius C, as shown on Fig. 10. Let J be a function on S, and let 11. be an adherent point of S. Let w be a complex number. We say that
w = lim J(z)
if the following condition is satisfied. Given E > 0 there exists 8 > 0 such that if z E Sand Iz - 11.1 < 8, then
IJ(z) - wi < E.

These definitions are completely analogous to those which you should have had in some analysis or advanced calculus course, so we don't spend much time on them. As usual, we have the rules for limits of sums, products, quotients as in calculus. If {zn} (n = 1,2, ... ) is a sequence of complex numbers, then we say that
w = lim Zn

Thus basic properties of limits for n --+ 00 are reduced to similar properties for functions. Note that in this case, the number 0 is not an element of S. A sequence {zn} is said to be a Cauchy sequence if, given E, there exists N such that if m, n ~ N, then
Write
Since
and
we conclude that {zn} is Cauchy if and only if the sequences {xn} and {Yn} of real and imaginary parts are also Cauchy. Since we know that real Cauchy sequences converge (i.e. have limits), we conclude that complex Cauchy sequences also converge. We note that all the usual theorems about limits hold for complex numbers: Limits of sums, limits of products, limits of quotients, limits


[I, §4] LIMITS AND COMPACT SETS 21

Hence the limit of the quotient is z/z = 1.
Compact Sets
We shall now go through the basic results concerning compact sets. Let S be a set of complex numbers. Let {Zll} be a sequence in S. By a point of accumulation of {Zll} we mean a complex number v such that given E (always assumed> 0) there exist infinitely many integers n such that
IZII - vi < E.
We may say that given an open set U containing v, there exist infinitely many n such that ZII E U. Similarly we define the notion of point of accumulation of an infinite set S. It is a complex number v such that given an open set U containing v, there exist infinitely many elements of S lying in U. In particular, a point of accumulation of S is adherent to S. We assume that the reader is acquainted with the Weierstrass-Bolzano theorem about sets of real numbers: If S is an infinite bounded set of real numbers, then S has a point of accumulation.
We define a set of complex numbers S to be compact if every sequence of elements of S has a point of accumulation in S. This property is equivalent to the following properties, which could be taken as alternate definitions:
(a) Every infinite subset of S has a point of accumulation in S.


22 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS [I, §4]
(b) Every sequence of elements of S has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in S.
We leave the proof of the equivalence between the three possible definitions to the reader.
Theorem 4.1. A set of complex numbers is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
Proof. Assume that S is compact. If S is not bounded, for each positive integer n there exists z" E S such that
Then the sequence {ZII} does not have a point of accumulation. Indeed, if v is a point of accumulation, pick m> 21vl, and note that Ivl > O. Then
This contradicts the fact that for infinitely many m we must have z,. close to v. Hence S is bounded. To show S is closed, let v be in its closure. Given n, there exists z" E S such that
Iz" - vi < lIn.
The sequence {z,,} converges to v, and has a subsequence converging to a limit in S because S is assumed compact. This limit must be v, whence v E Sand S is closed. Conversely, assume that S is closed and bounded, and let B be a bound, so Izi ~ B for all zE S. If we write
z = x + iy,
then Ixl ~ Band Iyl ~ B. Let {z,,} be a sequence in S, and write
z" = XII + iy".
There is a subsequence {z"J such that {XIII} converges to a real number a, and there is a sub-subsequence {Z"2} such that (y"2} converges to a real number b. Then
converges to a + ib, and S is compact. This proves the theorem.
Theorem 4.2. Let S be a compact set and let S1:::> S2 :::> ••• be a sequence of non-empty closed subsets such that S,,:::> S"H' Then the intersection of all S" for all n = 1, 2, ... is not empty.


[I, §4] LIMITS AND COMPACT SETS 23
Proof Let Zn E Sn. The sequence {zn} has a point of accumulation in S. Call it v. Then v is also a point of accumulation for each subsequence {Zk} with k ~ n, and hence lies in the closure of Sn for each n, But Sn is assumed closed, and hence v E Sn for all n. This proves the theorem.
Theorem 4.3. Let S be a compact set of complex numbers, and let f be a continuous function on S. Then the image of f is compact.
Proof Let {wn } be a sequence in the image of J, so that
for
The sequence {zn} has a convergent subsequence {znJ, with a limit v in S. Since f is continuous, we have
lim wnk = lim f(znk) = f(v).
k-+oo k-+oo
Hence the given sequence {wn} has a subsequence which converges in f(S). This proves that f(S) is compact.
Theorem 4.4. Let S be a compact set of complex numbers, and let
f: S-+R
be a continuous function. Then f has a maximum on S, that is, there exists v E S such that f(z) ~ f(v) for all Z E s.
Proof By Theorem 4.3, we know that f(S) is closed and bounded. Let b be its least upper bound. Then b is adherent to f(s), whence in f(S) because f(S) is closed. So there is some v E S such that f(v) = b. This proves the theorem.
Remarks. In practice, one deals with a continuous function f: S -+ C and one applies Theorem 4.4 to the absolute value of f, which is also continuous (composite of two continuous functions).
Theorem 4.5. Let S be a compact set, and let f be a continuous function on S. Then f is uniformly continuous, i.e. given E there exists b such that whenever z, WE Sand Iz - wi < b, then If(z) - f(w)1 < E.

Theorem 4.8. Let S be compact. Let r be a real number > O. There exists a finite number of open discs of radius r whose union contains S.
Proof Suppose this is false. Let Z1 E S and let Dl be the open disc of radius r centered at Zl' Then Dl does not contain S, and there is some Z2 E S, Z2 =I Zl' Proceeding inductively, suppose we have found open discs D1 , ... ,Dn of radius r centered at points Z l' ... ,Zn, respectively, such that Zk+l does not lie in Dl U··· U Dk • We can then find Zn+l which does not lie in Dl U ... u Dn, and we let Dn+1 be the disc of radius r centered at Zn+l' Let v be a point of accumulation of the sequence {zn}. By definition, there exist positive integers m, k with k > m such that
IZk - vi < rl2 and IZm - vi < r12.
Then IZk - zml < r and this contradicts the property of our sequence {zn} because Zk lies in the disc Dm. This proves the theorem.
Let S be a set of complex numbers, and let I be some set. Suppose that for each i E I we are given an open set Vi' We denote this association by {VJiEI, and call it a family of open sets. The union of the family is the set V consisting of all Z such that Z E Vi for some i E I. We say that the family covers S if S is contained in this union, that is, every Z E S is contained in some Vi' We then say that the family {Vi}iEI is an open covering of S. If J is a subset of I, we call the family {~LJ a subfamily, and if it covers S also, we call it a subcovering of S. In particular, if

Any point of Dn is then at a distance ~ 21N from w, and hence Dn is contained in D, and thus contained in Uio. This contradicts the hypothesis made on Dn , and proves the theorem.

I, §5. COMPLEX DIFFERENTIABILITY
In studying differentiable functions of a real variable, we took such functions defined on intervals. For complex variables, we have to select domains of definition in an analogous manner. Let U be an open set, and let z be a point of U. Let f be a function
on U. We say that f is complex differentiable at z if the limit
1. f(z + h) - f(z)
1m .:.....c..._~--'--'--'
h-+O h
exists. This limit is denoted by f'(z) or dfldz. In this section, differentiable will always mean complex differentiable. The usual proofs of a first course in calculus concerning basic properties of differentiability are valid for complex differentiability. We shall run through them again. We note that if f is differentiable at z then f is continuous at z because
lim (f(z + h) - f(z) = lim f(z + ~ - f(z) h
h-+O h-+O
and since the limit of a product is the product of the limits, the limit on
the right-hand side is equal to o.
We let f, g be functions defined on the open set U. We assume that J, g are differentiable at z.
Sum. The sum f + g is differentiable at z, and
(f + g)'(z) = f'(z) + g'(z).
Proof. This is immediate from the theorem that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
Product. The product f g is differentiable at z, and
(fg)'(z) = f'(z)g(z) + f(z)g'(z).


28 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS
Proof To determine the limit of the Newton quotient
J(z + h)g(z + h) - J(z)g(z) h
we write the numerator in the form
J(z + h)g(z + h) - J(z)g(z + h) + J(z)g(z + h) - J(z)g(z).
Then the Newton quotient is equal to a sum
J(z + h) - J(z) ( h) J( )g(z + h) - g(z)
h gz+ + z h .
Taking the limits yields the formula.
[I, §5]
Quotient. IJ g(z) =I- 0, then the quotient fig is differentiable at z, and
(f/g)'(z) = g(Z)J'(Z~~l(Z)g'(Z)
Proof This is again proved as in ordinary calculus. We first prove the differentiability of the quotient function l/g. We have
1
g(z + h) h
Taking the limit yields
1
g(z) g(z + h) - g(z) 1 h g(z + h)g(z)
1,
- g(Z)2 g (z),
which is the usual value. The general formula for a quotient is obtained from this by writing
J/g = J·l/g,
and using the rules for the derivative of a product, and the derivative of l/g.
Examples. As in ordinary calculus, from the formula for a product and induction, we see that for any positive integer n,


[I, §5] COMPLEX DIFFERENTIABILITY 29
The rule for a quotient also shows that this formula remains valid when n is a negative integer. The derivative of z2/(2z - I) is
(2z - 1)2z - 2Z2
(2z - If
This formula is valid for any complex number z such that 2z - I "# O. More generally, let
J(z) = P(z)/Q(z),
where P, Q are polynomials. Then J is differentiable at any point z where Q(z) "# O.
Last comes the chain rule. Let U, V be open sets in C, and let
J:U~V and g:V~C
be functions, such that the image of J is contained in V. Then we can form the composite function g 0 J such that
(g 0 J)(z) = g(J(z)).
Chain Rule. Let w = J(z). Assume that J is differentiable at z, and g is differentiable at w. Then g 0 J is differentiable at z, and
(g 0 f)'(z) = g'(J(z))J'(z).
Proof Again the proof is the same as in calculus, and depends on expressing differentiability by an equivalent property not involving denominators, as follows.
Suppose that J is differentiable at z, and let
<p(h) = J(z + h~ - J(z) _ J'(z).
Then
(1) J(z + h) - J(z) = J'(z)h + h<p(h),
and
(2) lim <p(h) = O.
h-'O


30 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS [I, §5]
Furthermore, even though qJ is at first defined only for sufficiently small hand h oF 0, we may also define qJ(O) = 0, and formula (1) remains valid for h = O. Conversely, suppose that there exists a function qJ defined for sufficiently small h and a number a such that
(1') J(z + h) - J(z) = ah + hqJ(h)
and
(2) lim qJ(h) = o.
" .... 0
Dividing by h in formula (1') and taking the limit as h -+ 0, we see that the limit exists and is equal to a. Thus f'(z) exists and is equal to a. Hence the existence of a function qJ satisfying (1'), (2) is equivalent to differentiability.
We apply this to a proof of the chain rule. Let w = J(z), and
k = J(z + h) - J(z),
so that
g(j(z + h)) - g(j(z)) = g(w + k) - g(w).
There exists a function t/I(k) such that lim t/I(k) = 0 and
k .... O
g(w + k) - g(w) = g'(w)k + kt/l(k)
= g'(w)(J(z + h) - J(z)) + (J(z + h) - J(z))t/I(k).
Dividing by h yields
g 0 J(z + h) - 9 0 J(z) = '( ) J(z + h) - J(z) J(z + h) - J(z) '/'(k)
h gw h + h '1'.
As h -+ 0, we note that k -+ 0 also by the continuity of J, whence t/I(k) -+ 0 by assumption. Taking the limit of this last expression as h -+ 0 proves the chain rule.
A function J defined on an open set U is said to be differentiable if it is differentiable at every point. We then also say that J is holomorphic on U. The word holomorphic is usually used in order not to have to specify complex differentiability as distinguished from real differentiability.


[I, §6] THE CAUCHY-RIEMANN EQUATIONS 31
In line with general terminology, a holomorphic function
J:U~V
from an open set into another is called a bolomorpbic isomorphism if there exists a holomorphic function
g:V~U
such that g is the inverse of f, that is,
go J = idu and Jog = idv.
A holomorphic isomorphism of U with itself is called a holomorphic automorphism. In the next chapter we discuss this notion in connection with functions defined by power series.
I, §6. THE CAUCHY-RIEMANN EQUATIONS
Let J be a function on an open set U, and write J in terms of its real and imaginary parts,
J(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y).
It is reasonable to ask what the condition of differentiability means in terms of u and v. We shall analyze this situation in detail in Chapter VIII, but both for the sake of tradition, and because there is some need psychologically to see right away what the answer is, we derive the equivalent conditions on u, v for J to be holomorphic. At a fixed z, let f'(z) = a + bi. Let w = h + ik, with h, k real. Suppose that
J(z + w) - J(z) = f'(z)w + u(w)w,
where
lim u(w) = o.
w.... o
Then
f'(z)w = (a + bi)(h + ki) = ah - bk + i(bh + ak).
On the other hand, let


32 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS [I, §6]
be the map (often called vector field) such that
F(x, y) = (u(x, y), vex, y)).
We call F the (real) vector field associated with f. Then
F(x + h, y + k) - F(x, y) = (ah - bk, bh + ak) + 0'1 (h, k)h + 0'2(h, k)k,
where 0'1 (h, k), 0'2(h, k) are functions tending to 0 as (h, k) tends to O. Hence if we assume that f is holomorphic, we conclude that F is differentiable in the sense of real variables, and that its derivative is represented by the (Jacobian) matrix
This shows that
and
OU OU ox oy
( a -b)
JF(x, y) = b a = ov ov

f'(z) = ou _ i OU

ox = oy and
These are called the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
Conversely, let u(x, y) and v(x, y) be two functions satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and continuously differentiable in the sense of real functions. Define
f(z) = f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y).
Then it is immediately verified by reversing the above steps that f is complex-differentiable, i.e. holomorphic. The Jacobian determinant AF of the associated vector field F is
( OU)2 (OV)2 (OU)2 (OU)2
AF = a2 + b2 = ox + ox = ox + oy

Hence llF ~ 0, and is #0 if and only if f'(z) # o. We have
We now drop these considerations until Chapter VIII. The study of the real part of a holomorphic function and its relation with the function itself will be carried out more substantially in Chapter VIII. It is important, and much of that chapter depends only on elementary facts. However, the most important part of complex analysis at the present level lies in the power series aspects and the immediate applications of Cauchy's theorem. The real part plays no role in these matters. Thus we do not wish to interrupt the straightforward flow of the book now towards these topics. However, the reader may read immediately the more elementary parts §1 and §2 of Chapter VIII, which can be understood already at this point.
I, §6. EXERCISE
1. Prove in detail that if u, v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then the function

I, §7. ANGLES UNDER HOLOMORPHIC MAPS
In this section, we give a simple geometric property of holomorphic maps. Roughly speaking, they preserve angles. We make this precise as follows. Let U be an open set in C and let
y:[a,b]-+U
be a curve in U, so we write
y(t) = x(t) + iy(t).
We assume that y is differentiable, so its derivative is given by
y'(t) = x'(t) + iy'(t).


34 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS [I, §1)
Let I: U .... C be holomorphic. We let the reader verify the chain rule
ddtJ(y(t» = !'(r(t»y'(t).
We interpret y'(t) as a vector in the direction of a tangent vector at the point yet). This derivative y'(t), if not 0, defines the direction of the curve at the point.

neorem 7.1. II !'(zo) =F 0 then the angle between the curves 'I, '1 at zo is the same as the angle between the curves loy, I 0 '1 at I(zo).
Proof Geometrically speaking, the tangent vectors under I are changed by multiplication with !'(zo), which can be represented in polar coordinates as a dilation and a rotation, so preserves the angles.


[I, §7] ANGLES UNDER HOLOMORPHIC MAPS 35
We shall now give a more formal argument, dealing with the cosine and sine of angles. Let z. w be complex numbers,
z = a + bi and w = c + di,
where a, b, c. d are real. Then
zw = ac + bd + i(bc - ad).
Define the scalar product
(1) (z, w) = Re(zw).
Then (z. w) is the ordinary scalar product of the vectors (a, b) and (c, d) in R2. Let 9(z, w) be the angle between z and w. Then
(2) (z. w)
cos 9(z, w) = - - .

Since sin (I = cos ( 9 - ~), we can define
(3) . 0.( ) (z, -iw)
sm z, w = .
Izllwl
This gives us the desired precise formulas for the cosine and sine of an angle. which determine the angle. Let /'(zo) = IX. Then
(4)
because aiX = 11X12 is real. It follows immediately from the above formulas that
(5) cos O(IXZ, IXW) = cos O(z, w) and sin O(IXZ, IXW) = sin O(z. w).
This proves the theorem.
A map which preserves angles is called conformal. Thus we can say that a holomorphic map with non-zero derivative is conformal. The complex conjugate of a holomorphic map also preserves angles, if we disregard the orientation of an angle. In Chapter VII, we shall consider holomorphic maps which have inverse hoiomorphic maps, and therefore such that their derivatives are


36 COMPLEX NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS [I, §7]
never equal to O. The theorem proved in this section gives additional geometric information concerning the nature of such maps. But the emphasis of the theorem in this section is local, whereas the emphasis in Chapter VII will be global. The word "conformal", however, has become a code word for this kind of map, even in the global case, which explains the title of Chapter VII. The reader will notice that the local property of preserving angles is irrelevant for the global arguments given in Chapter VII, having to do with inverse mappings. Thus in Chapter VII, we shall use a terminology which emphasizes the invertibility, namely the terminology of isomorphisms and automorphisms. In this terminology, we can say that a holomorphic isomorphism is conformal. The converse is false in general. For instance, let U be the open set obtained by deleting the origin from the complex numbers. The function
f: U -+ U given by
has everywhere non-zero derivative in U, but it does not admit an inverse function. This function f is definitely conformal. The invertibility is true locally, however. See Theorem 5.1 of Chapter II.


CHAPTER II
Power Series
So far, we have given only rational functions as examples of holomorphic functions. We shall study other ways of defining such functions. One of the principal ways will be by means of power series. Thus we shall see that the series
Z2 Z3
l+z+-+-+'"
2! 3!
converges for all z to define a function which is equal to eZ• Similarly, we shall extend the values of sin z and cos z by their usual series to complex valued functions of a complex variable, and we shall see that they have similar properties to the functions of a real variable which you already know. First we shall learn to manipulate power series formally. In elementary calculus courses, we derived Taylor's formula with an error term. Here we are concerned with the full power series. In a way, we pick up where calculus left off. We study systematically sums, products, inverses, and composition of power series, and then relate the formal operations with questions of convergence.
II, §1. FORMAL POWER SERIES
We select at first a neutral letter, say T. In writing a formal power series
0L0 an Tn = ao + a1 T + a2T2 + ...
n=O
37


38 POWER SERIES [II, §1]
what is essential are its "coefficients" ao, a1, a2, •.. which we shall take as complex numbers. Thus the above series may be defined as the function
nl-+a"
from the integers ~ 0 to the complex numbers. We could use other letters besides T, writing
f(T) = 'La,.T",
f(r) = 'La"T",
f(z) = 'La,.z".
In such notation, f does not denote a function, but a formal expression. Also, as a matter of notation, we write a single term
a,.T"
to denote the power series such that air; = 0 if k # n. For instance, we would write
for the power series
o+ or + or2 + 5r3 + or'" + "',
such that a3 = 5 and a" = 0 if k # 3.
By definition, we call ao the constant term of f. If
and g = 'Lb"T"
are such formal power series, we define their sum to be
f + g = 'Lc"T-,
We define their product to be
fg = 'Ld"T~,
where Cn = a" + b".
..
where d" = 'L a"b.._t .
1=0
The sum and product are therefore defined just as for polynomials. The first few terms of the product can be written as


[II, §1] FORMAL POWER SERIES 39
If IX is a complex number, we define
to be the power series whose n-th coefficient is lXan • Thus we can multiply power series by numbers. Just as for polynomials, one verifies that the sum and product are associative, commutative, and distributive. Thus in particular, if f, g, h are power series, then
f(g + h) = fg + jh (distributivity).
We omit the proof, which is just elementary algebra. The zero power series is the series such that an = 0 for all integers n ~ O.
Suppose a power series is of the form
f = arT r + ar+1 T r+1 + "',
and ar =I O. Thus r is the smallest integer n such that an =I O. Then we call r the order of f, and write
r = ord f
If ord g = s, so that
g = bs T S + bs+1 T s+1 + ... ,
and bs =I 0, then by definition,
fg = arbs T r+s + higher terms,
and arbs =I O. Hence
ord fg = ord f + ord g.
A power series has order 0 if and only if it starts with a non-zero constant term. For instance, the geometric series
1 + T + T2 + T3 + ...
has order O.
Let f = L an Tn be a power series. We say that g = L bnTn IS an


40 POWER SERIES [II, §1]
inverse for f if
fg = 1.
In view of the relation for orders which we just mentioned, we note that if an inverse exists, then we must have
ord f = ord g = O.
In other words, both f and g start with non-zero constant terms. The converse is true:
If f has a non-zero constant term, then f has an inverse as a power series.
Proof Considering ao1f instead of f, we are reduced to the case when the constant term is equal to 1. We first note that the old geometric series gives us a formal inverse,
-1- = 1 + r + r2 + ....
1-r
Written multiplicatively, this amounts to
(1 - r)(1 + r + r2 + ... ) = 1 + r + r2 + ... - r(1 + r + r2 + ...)
=1+r+r2+"·-r-r2- ...
=1.
Next, write
J=1-h, where h = -(a1 T + a2 T2 + "').
To find the inverse (1 - htl is now easy, namely it is the power series
qJ = 1 + h + h2 + h3 + ....
We have to verify that this makes sense. Any finite sum
1 + h + h2 + ... + hm
makes sense because we have defined sums and products of power series. Observe that the order of h" is at least n, because h" is of the form
(-1)"a~ Til + higher terms.


[II, §1] FORMAL POWER SERIES 41
Thus in the above sum (*), if m > n, then the term hm has all coefficients
of order ~ n equal to o. Thus we may define the n-th coefficient of cp to be the n-th coefficient of the finite sum
It is then easy to verify that
(1 - h)cp = (1 - h)(1 + h + h2 + h3 + ... )
is equal to
1 + a power series of arbitrarily high order,
and consequently is equal to 1. Hence we have found the desired inverse for f
Example. Let
T2 T4
cos T = 1 - - + - - ...
2! 4!
be the formal power series whose coefficients are the same as for the Taylor expansion of the ordinary cosine function in elementary calculus. We want to write down the first few terms of its (formal) inverse,
1
cos T
Up to terms of order 4, these will be the same as
1 (-1 1)
= 1 +"2 T2 + 24 + 4 T4 + higher terms.
This gives us the coefficients of 1/cos T up to order 4.


42 POWER SERIES [II, §1]
The substitution of h in the geometric series used to find an inverse can be generalized. Let
be a power series, and let
h(T) = Cl T + ...
be a power series whose constant term is 0, so ord h ~ 1. Then we may "substitute" h in f to define a power series f 0 h or f(h), by
in a natural way. Indeed, the finite sums
are defined by the ordinary sum and product of power series. If m > n, then amhm has order > n; in other words, it is a power series starting with non-zero terms of order > n. Consequently we can define the power series f 0 h as that series whose n-th coefficient is the n-th coefficient of
This composition of power series, like addition and multiplication, can therefore be computed by working only with polynomials. In fact, it is useful to discuss this approximation by polynomials a little more systematically.
We say that two power series f = Lan Tn and g = LbnTn are con
gruent mod TN and write f == g (mod TN) if
for n = 0, ... ,N - 1.
This means that the terms of order ~ N - 1 coincide for the two power series. Given the power series f, there is a unique polynomial P(T) of degree ~ N - 1 such that
f(T) == P(T) (mod TN),
namely the polynomial


[II, §1] FORMAL POWER SERIES 43
and
If hI' h2 are power series with zero constant term, and
then
Proof We leave the sum and product to the reader. Let us look at the proof for the composition fl 0 hI and f2 0 h2. First suppose h has zero constant term. Let PI' P2 be the polynomials of degree N - 1 such that
and
Then by hypothesis, PI = P2 = P is the same polynomial, and
Next let Q be the polynomial of degree N - 1 such that
Write P = ao + a1T + ... + aN-l TN-I. Then
P(h1 ) = ao + a 1 h1 + ... + aN_l hf- 1
== ao + a1Q + '" + aN_IQN-l
== ao + a1h2 + ... + aN_lh~-1
== P(h2 ) (mod TN).
This proves the desired property, that fl 0 hI == f2 0 h2 (mod TN).
With these rules we can compute the coefficients of various operations between power series by reducing the computations to polynomial operations, which amount to high-school algebra. Indeed, two power series J, g are equal if and only if
for every positive integer N. Verifying that f == g (mod TN) can be


44 POWER SERIES [II, §l]
done by working entirely with polynomials of degree < N.
If fl' f2 are power series, then
(fl + f2)(h) = fl (h) + f2(h),
(fd2)(h) = fl (h)f2(h), and (fdf2)(h) = fl (h)lf2(h)
if ord f2 = O. If g, h have constant terms equal to 0, then
f{g(h» = (f 0 g)(h).
Proof. In each case, the proof is obtained by reducing the statement to the polynomial case, and seeing that the required properties hold for polynomials, which is standard. For instance, for the associativity of composition, given a positive integer N, let P, Q, R be polynomials of degree ~ N - I such that
f='P, g=.Q,
The ordinary theory of polynomials shows that
P{Q(R» = (P 0 Q)(R).
The left-hand side is congruent to f(g(h», and the right-hand side is congruent to (f 0 g)(h) (mod TN) by the properties which have already been proved. lIenee
f{g(h» =. (f 0 g)(h) (mod TN).
This is true for each N, whence f(g(h)} = (f 0 g)(h), as desired.
In applications it is useful to consider power series which have a finite number of terms involving liz, and this amounts also to considering arbitrary quotients of power series as follows. Just as fractions min are formed with integers m, nand n :F 0, we can form quotients
fig = f(T)/g(T)
of power series such that g :F O. Two such quotients fig and fdgl are regarded as equal if and only if
which is exactly the condition under which we regard two rational num

f(T) = amTm + am+1 T m+1 + ... = L anTn
n;;;m
be a power series with am =I- O. We may then write f in the form
where h(T) has zero constant term. Consequently Ilf has the form
11
Ilf = am T m1 + h(T)
We know how to invert 1 + h(T), say
Then Ilf(T) has the shape
It is a power series with a finite number of terms having negative powers of T. In this manner, one sees that an arbitrary quotient can always be expressed as a power series of the form
J; C-m C- m +l 2
"g = - + - - + .. , + c + c T + c T + ...

If em =I- 0, then we call -m the order of fig. It is again verified as for power series without negative terms that if

ord <P<PI = ord <P + ord <PI •

If A = I exn and B = I Pn are two convergent series, with partial sums

Let {cn } be a series of real numbers Cn ~ o. If the partial sums

Let I exn be a series of complex numbers. We shall say that this series converges absolutely if the real positive series

Assuming absolute convergence, given E there exists N such that if n, m ~ N, then the right-hand side of this last expression is < E, thereby proving that the partial sums form a Cauchy sequence, and hence that the series converges. We have the usual test for convergence:
Let L Cn be a series of real numbers ~ 0 which converges. If locnl ~ Cn
for all n, then the series L ocn converges absolutely.
Proof The partial sums
are bounded by assumption, whence the partial sums

are also bounded, and the absolute convergence follows.
In the sequel we shall also assume some standard facts about absolutely convergent series, namely:
(i) If a series :E OCn is absolutely convergent, then the series obtained by any rearrangement of the terms is also absolutely convergent, and converges to the same limit. (ii) If a double series
is absolutely convergent, then the order of summation can be interchanged, and the series so obtained is absolutely convergent, and converges to the same value.
The proof is easily obtained by considering approximating partial sums (finite sums), and estimating the tail ends. We omit it. We shall now consider series of functions, and deal with questions of uniformity.
Let S be a set, and f a bounded function on S. Then we define the

where sup means least upper bound. It is a norm in the sense that for two functions f, g we have Ilf + gil ~ 1If11 + IIgll, and for any number c we have Ilcfll = Jclllfil. Also f = 0 if and only if 1If11 = O. Let Un} (n = 1,2, ... ) be a sequence of functions on S. We shall say
that this sequence converges uniformly on S if there exists a function f on S satisfying the following properties. Given E, there exists N such that if n ~ N, then
We say that {.f..} is a Cauchy sequence (for the sup norm~ if given t, there exists N such that if m, n ~ N, then

This is true for any z, and therefore II f - f" II < 2E, which proves the theorem.
Remark. It is immediately seen that if the functions f" in the theorem
are bounded, then the limiting function f is also bounded.

converges. The next theorem is sometimes called the comparison test.
Theorem 2.2. Let {cn } be a sequence of real numbers ~ 0, and assume that

The assumption that I Ck converges implies at once the uniform convergence of the partial sums. The argument also shows that the convergence is absolute.
Theorem 2.3. Let S be a set of complex numbers, and let {In} be a sequence of continuous functions on S. If this sequence converges uniformly, then the limit function f is also continuous.
Proof You should already have seen this theorem some time during a calculus course. We reproduce the proof for convenience. Let oc E S. Select n so large that II f - f" II < E. For this choice of n, using the continuity of f" at oc, select b such that whenever Iz - atl < () we have

Example. For any r > 0, the series

Take n ~ 2r. Then the right-hand side is ~ 1/2. Hence for all n sufficiently large, we have
Therefore there exists some positive integer no such that


[II, §2] CONVERGENT POWER SERIES 53
for some constant C and all n ~ no. We may therefore compare our series with a geometric series to get the absolute and uniform convergence.
The series
OCJ
exp(z) = L zn/n!
n=O
therefore defines a continuous function for all values of z. Similarly, the series

sin z = z - - + - - ... = L (- 1t -:-::--------:-:-0

Z2 Z4 OCJ z2n
cos Z = 1 - - + - - ... = L ( - 1 t 
2! 4! n=O (2n)!
converge absolutely and uniformly for all Izl ~ r. They give extensions of the sine and cosine functions to the complex numbers. We shall see later that exp(z) = eZ as defined in Chapter I, and that these series define the unique analytic functions which coincide with the usual exponential, sine, and cosine functions, respectively, when z is real.
Theorem 2.5. Let L anz n be a power series. If it does not converge absolutely for all z, then there exists a number r such that the series converges absolutely for Izl < r and does not converge absolutely for Izl > r.
Proof Suppose that the series does not converge absolutely for all z. Let r be the least upper bound of those numbers s f'; 0 such that
converges. Then L lanllzln diverges if Izl > r, and converges if Izl < r by the comparison test, so our assertion is obvious.
The number r in Theorem 2.5 is called the radius of convergence of the power series. If the power series converges absolutely for all z, then we say that its radius of convergence is infinity. When the radius of convergence is 0, then the series converges absolutely only for z = 0. If a power series has a non-zero radius of convergence, then it is called a convergent power series. If D is a disc centered at the origin and contained in the disc D(O, r), where r is the radius of convergence, then we say that the power series converges on D. The radius of convergence can be determined in terms of the coefficients. Let tn be a sequence of real numbers. We recall that a point of accumulation of this sequence is a number t such that, given E, there exist


54 POWER SERIES [II, §2]
infinitely many indices n such that
Itn - tl < E.
In other words, infinitely many points of the sequence lie in a given interval centered at t. An elementary property of real numbers asserts that every bounded sequence has a point of accumulation (WeierstrassBalzano theorem). Assume now that {tn} is a bounded sequence. Let S be the set of points of accumulation, so that S looks like Fig. 1.
IIIII~IIII I
Figure 1
We define the limit superior, lim sup, of the sequence to be
A= lim sup tn = least upper bound of S.
Then the reader will verify at once that A is itself a point of accumulation of the sequence, and is therefore the largest such point. Furthermore, A has the following properties:
Given E, there exist only finitely many n such that tn ~ A + E. There exist infinitely many n such that
Proof If there were infinitely many n such that tn ~ A+ E, then the sequence {tn} would have a point of accumulation
contrary to assumption. On the other hand, since A itself is a point of accumulation, given the E-interval about A, there have to be infinitely many n such that tn lies in this E-interval, thus proving the second assertion. We leave it to the reader to verify that if a number A has the above properties, then it is the lim sup of the sequence.
For convenience, if {tn } is not bounded from above, we define its lim sup to be infinity, written 00.


[II, §2] CONVERGENT POWER SERIES 55
As an exercise, you should prove:
Let {tIl}' {sIll be sequences of real numbers ~ O. Let
t = lim sup tIl and s = lim sup s".
Then lim sup(t" + s,,) ~ t + s.
If t =F 0, then
lim sup(t"s,,) ~ ts.
If lim tIl exists, then t = lim t".
" .... 00
This last statement says that if the sequence has an ordinary limit, then that limit is the lim sup of the sequence. The second statement is often applied in case one sequence has a lim sup, and the other sequence has a limit =F O. The hypothesis t =F 0 is made only to allow the possibility that s = 00, in which case ts is understood to be 00. If s =F 00, and t =F 00, and lim tIl exists, then it is true unrestrictedly that
lim sup(t"s,,) = ts.
Theorem 2.6. Let La"z" be a power series, and let r be its radius of convergence. Then
If r = 0, this relation is to be interpreted as meaning that the sequence {la,,11/"} is not bounded. If r = 00, it is to be interpreted as meaning that lim sup Ia" 11/" = O.
Proof Let t = lim suplanI1/". Suppose first that t =F 0, 00. Given E > 0, there exist only a finite number of n such that Ian 11/" ~ t + E. Thus for all but a finite number of n, we have
la,,1 ~ (t + E)",
whence the series La"z" converges absolutely if Izl < 1/(t + E), by comparison with the geometric series. Therefore the radius of convergence r satisfies r ~ 1/(t + E) for every € > 0, whence r ~ lit.


56 POWER SERIES [II, §2]
Conversely, given E there exist infinitely many n such that lanl!/n ~ t - E, and therefore
Hence the series I: anzn does not converge if Izl = 1/(1 - E), because its n-th term does not even tend to O. Therefore the radius of convergence r satisfies r ~ l/(t - E) for every E > 0, whence r ~ 1/t. This concludes the proof in case t '" 0, 00.
The case when t = 0 or 00 will be left to the reader. The above arguments apply, even with some simplifications.
Corollary 2.7. If lim lanl!/n = t exists, then r = l/t.
Proof. If the limit exists, then t is the only point of accumulation of
the sequence lanl!/n, and the theorem states that t = l/r.
Corollary 2.8. Suppose that Lanzn has a radius of convergence greater
than O. Then there exists a positive number C such that if A > l/r then
for all n.
Proof. Let s = 1/A so 0 < S < r at the beginning of the proof of the theorem.
In the next examples, we shall use a weak form of Stirling's formula, namely
where lim u!/n = 1.
You can prove this estimate by comparing the integral
J: log x dx = n log n - n + 1
with the upper and lower Riemann sums on the interval [1, n], using the partition consisting of the integers from 1 to n. This is a very simple exercise in calculus. Exponentiating the inequalities given by the Riemann sums yields the weak form of Stirling's formula. Let {an}, {bn} be two sequences of positive numbers. We shall write
for n .... 00
if for each n there exists a positive real number Un such that lim u!/n = 1, and an = bnun. If lim a!/n exists, and an == bn, then lim b~/n exists and is equal to lim a!/lI. We can use this result in the following examples.


[II, §2] CONVERGENT POWER SERIES 57
Example. The radius of convergence of the series L n! zn is O. Indeed, we have n! == nne-n and (n !)l/n is unbounded as n -+ 00.

lin! == enlnn so (lln!)l/n -+ 0 as n -+ 00.
Example. The radius of convergence of L(n !jnn)zn is e, because
n!jnn == e-n, so lim(n!/nn)l/n = e-1•
Ratio Test. Let {an} be a sequence of positive numbers, and assume that
lim an+l/an = A ~ O. Then lim a~/n = A also.
Proof Suppose first A > 0 for simplicity. Given I" > 0, let no be such
that A - I" ;;;; an+l/an ;;;; A + E if n ~ no. Without loss of generality, we can
assume E < A so A - I" > O. Write
Then by induction, there exist constants CI (E) and C2 (E) such that
There exists N ~ no such that for n ~ N we have
C{(E)I/n = I +J1(n) where IJ1(n)1 ;;;; E/(A - E),
and similarly q(E)I/n = I +J2(n) with IJ2(n)1 ;;;; EI(A + E). Then
This shows that la~/n - A I ;;;; 21", and concludes the proof of the ratio test
when A > O. If A = 0, one can simply replace the terms on the left of the inequalities by 0 throughout.

Sums and Products
Let f = f(T) and 9 = g(T) be formal power series. We may form their formal product and sum, f + 9 and fg. If f converges absolutely for some complex number z, then we have the value f(z), and similarly for g(z).
Theorem 3.1. If f, 9 are power series which converge absolutely on the disc D(O, r), then f + 9 and fg also converge absolutely on this disc. If a is a complex number, af converges absolutely on this disc, and we have
(f + g)(z) = f(z) + g(z), (fg)(z) = f(z)g(z),
(cif)(z) = a' f(z)
for all z in the disc.
Proof. We give the proof for the product, which is the hardest. Let

62 POWER SERIES [II, §3]
thereby proving the theorem for the product.
The previous theorem shows that a formal power series determines a function on the disc of absolute convergence. We can raise the question: If two formal power series f, g give rise to the same function on some neighborhood of 0, are they equal as formal power series? Subtracting g from f, this amounts to asking: If a power series determines the zero function on some disc centered at the origin, is it the zero series, i.e. are all its coefficients equal to O? The answer is yes. In fact, more is true.
Theorem 3.2.
(a) Let f(T) = 'LanTn be a non-constant power series, having a nonzero radius of convergence. If f(O) = 0, then there exists s> 0 such that f(z) =1= 0 for all z with Izl ;::;;; s, and z =1= O. (b) Let f(T) = 'LanTn and g(T) = 'LbnTn be two convergent power series. Suppose that f(x) = g(x) for all points x in an infinite set having 0 as a point of accumulation. Then f(T) = g(T), that is an = bn for all n.
Proof We can write
f(z) = amzm+ higher terms, and am =1= 0
= amzm(l + btZ + b2 z2 + ... )
=amzm(1 + h(z)),
where h(z) = bt z + b2 z2 + ... is a power series having a non-zero radius of convergence, and zero constant term. For all sufficiently small Izl, the value Ih(z)1 is small, and hence
1 + h(z) =1= O.
If z =1= 0, then amzm=1= O. This proves the first part of the theorem.
For part (b), let h(t) = f(T) - g(T) = L(an- bn)T". We have h(x) = 0 for an infinite set of points x having 0 as point of accumulation. By part (a), this implies that h(T) is the zero power series, so an = bn for all n, thus proving the theorem.
Example. There exists at most one convergent power series f(T) = ~>n Til such that for some interval [ -E, E] we have f(x) = eX for all x in [ -E, E]. This proves the uniqueness of any power series extension of the exponential function to all complex numbers. Similarly, one has the uniqueness of the power series extending the sine and cosine functions.


[II, §3] RELA TIONS BETWEEN FORMAL AND CONVERGENT SERIES 63
Furthermore, let exp(z) = L znln!. Then
exp(iz) = L (iz)nIn!.
Summing over even n and odd n, we find that
exp(iz) = C(z) + is(z),
where C(z) and S(z) are the power series for the cosine and sine of z respectively. Hence ei8 for real () coincides with exp(i()) as given by the power series expansion. Quite generally, if g(T), h(T) are power series with 0 constant term, then
exp(g(T) +h(T)) = (expg(T))(exph(T)).
Proof On one hand, by definition,
and on the other hand,
00 n (T)kh(Tr-k
(expg(T)) (exph(T)) = ~{;g k!(n _ k)!
= ~ (g(T) + h(T)r
~ qed.
n=O n!
In particular, for complex numbers z, w we have
exp(z + w) = (expz)(exp w),
because we can apply the above identity to g(T) = zT and h(T) = wT, and then substitute T = 1. Thus we see that the exponential function eZ defined in Chapter I has the same values as the function defined by the usual power series exp(z). From now on, we make no distinction between eZ and exp(z). Theorem 3.2 also allows us to conclude that any polynomial relation between the elementary functions which have a convergent Taylor expansion at the origin also holds for the extension of these functions as complex power series.
Example. We can now conclude that sin2 z + cos2 Z = 1, where sinz = S(z), cosz = C(z) are defined by the usual power series. Indeed, the
power series S(z)2 + C(z)2 has infinite radius of convergence, and has value I for all real z. Theorem 3.2 implies that there is at most one series having this property, and that is the series 1, as desired. It would be disagreeable to show directly that the formal power series for the sine and


64 POWER SERIES [II, §3]
cosine satisfy this relation. It is easier to do it through elementary calculus as above.
Example. Let m be a positive integer. We have seen in §2 that the binomial series
with (X = 11m has a radius of convergence ~ 1, and thus converges absolutely for JzJ < 1. By elementary calculus, we have
B(x)m = 1 + x
when x is real, and JxJ < 1 (or even when JxJ is sufficiently small). Therefore B(T)m is the unique formal power series such that
B(x)m = 1 + x
for all sufficiently small real x, and therefore we conclude that
B(Tt = 1 + T.
In this manner, we see that we can take m-th roots
(1 + z)l/m

In our discussion of fonnal power series, besides the polynomial relations, we dealt with quotients and also composition of series. We still have to relate these to the convergent case. It will be convenient to introduce a simple notation to estimate power series.
Let f(T) = Lan rn be a power series. Let
be a power series with real coefficients Cn ~ O. We say that f is dominated by qJ, and write
f«qJ or f(T) « qJ(T),
if JanJ ~ Cn for all n. It is clear that if qJ, IjJ are power series with real co

f -< cp, g -< 1jI, then
f+g-<cp+1jI and fg -< cpljl.
Theorem 3.3. Suppose that f has a non-zero radius of convergence, and non-zero constant term. Let g be the formal power series which is inverse to f, that is, fg = 1. Then g also has a non-zero radius of convergence.
Proof Multiplying f by some constant, we may assume without loss of generality that the constant term is 1, so we write
f = 1 + at T + a2 T2 + ... = 1 - h(T),
where h(T) has constant term equal to O. By Corollary 2.8, we know that there exists a number A > 0 such that
(We can take C = 1 by picking A large enough.) Then

Therefore g(T) is dominated by a product of power series having nonzero radius of convergence, whence g(T) itself a non-zero radius of convergence, as was to be shown.

Composition of Series
Theorem 3.4. Let
and
be convergent power series, and assume that the constant term of h is O. Assume that f(z) is absolutely convergent for Izl ~ r, with r > 0, and that s > 0 is a number such that
Let 9 = f(h) be the formal power series obtained by composition,
Then 9 converges absolutely for Izl ~ s, and for such z,
g(z) = f{h(z)).
Proof Let g(T) = L cn Tn. Then g(T) is dominated by the series
and by hypothesis, the series on the right converges absolutely for Izl ~ s, so g(z) converges absolutely for Izl ~ s. Let
be the polynomial of degree ~ N - 1 beginning the power series f Then
and f{h(T)) = g(T) by definition. By the absolute convergence we conclude: Given E, there exists No such that if N ~ No and Izl ~ s, then
Since the polynomials fN converge uniformly to the function f on the closed disc of radius r, we can pick No sufficiently large so that for


[II, §3] RELA TrONS BETWEEN FORMAL AND CONVERGENT SERIES 67
N ~ No we have
IfN(h(z)) - f{h(z))1 < E.
This proves that
Ig(z) - f(h(z))1 < 2E,
for every E, whence g(z) - f(h(z)) = 0, thereby proving the theorem.
Example. Let rn be a positive integer, and let h(z) be a convergent power series with zero constant term. Then we can form the rn-th root
(1 +h(z))l/m
by the binomial expansion, and this rn-th root is a convergent power series whose rn-th power is 1 + h(z).
Example. Define

Readers should immediately recognize that the series on the right is the usual series of calculus for 10g(1 + w) when w = x and x is real. This series converges absolutely for Iwl < 1. We can therefore define log z for Iz - 11 < 1 by log z = f(z - 1).
We leave it as Exercise 1 to verify that exp log z = z.

So far we have looked at power series expansions at the origin. Let f be a function defined in some neighborhood of a point Zo0 We say that f is analytic at Zo if there exists a power series

[II, §4] ANAL YTIC FUNCTIONS 69
Suppose f is a function on an open set U. We say that f is analytic on U if f is analytic at every point of U. In the light of the uniqueness theorem for power series, Theorem 3.2, we see that the above power series expressing f in some neighborhood of Zo is uniquely determined. We have
f(zo) = 0 if and only if ao = o.
A point Zo such that f(zo) = 0 is called a zero of f Instead of saying that f is analytic at zo, we also say that f has a power series expansion at Zo (meaning that the values of f(z) for z near Zo are given by an absolutely convergent power series as above). If S is an arbitrary set, not necessarily open, it is useful to make the convention that a function is analytic on S if it is the restriction of an analytic function on an open set containing S. This is useful, for instance, when S is a closed disc. The theorem concerning sums, products, quotients and composites of convergent power series now immediately imply:
If f, g are analytic on U, so are f + g, fg. Also fig is analytic on the open subset of z E U such that g(z) =I- O.
If g: U ..... V is analytic and f: V ..... C is analytic, then fog is analytic.
For this last assertion, we note that if Zo E U and g(zo) = Wo, so
g(z) = Wo + Lb,,(z - zo)" and f(w) = La,,(w - wo)"
,,~1 ,,~o
for w near Wo, then g(z) - Wo is represented by a power series h(z - zo) without constant term, so that Theorem 3.4 applies: We can "substitute"
to get the power series representation for f(g(z) in a neighborhood of
zoo The next theorem, although easy to prove, requires being stated. It gives us in practice a way of finding a power series expansion for a function at a point.
Theorem 4.1. Let f(z) = La"z" be a power series whose radius of convergence is r. Then f is analytic on the open disc D(O, r).
Proof We have to show that f has a power series expansion at an arbitrary point Zo of the disc, so IZol < r. Let s > 0 be such that


70 POWER SERIES [II, §4]
IZol + s < r. We shall see that J can be represented by a convergent power series at zo, converging absolutely on a disc of radius s centered
at Zoo
Figure 2
We write
so that
Z" = (zo + (z - zo))". Then
If Iz - zol < s then IZol + Iz - zol < r, and hence the series
converges. Then we can interchange the order of summation, to get
which converges absolutely also, as was to be shown.
Example. Let us find the terms of order ~ 3 in the power series expansion of the function
J(Z) = Z2/(Z + 2)


[II, §4] ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS 71
at the point Zo = 1. We write
z = 1 + (z - 1), z + 2 = 3 + (z - 1).
Let == denote congruence mod(z - 1)4 (so disregard terms of order > 3). Then
Hence
Z2 = 1 + 2(z - 1) + (z - 1)2
Z + 2= 3(1 + ~(z - 1))

These are the desired terms of the expansion.
Remark. Making a translation, the theorem shows that if f has a power series expansion on a disc D(zo, r), that is,
for Iz - zol < r, then f is analytic on this disc.

Let D(O, r) be a disc of radius r > 0. A function f on the disc for which
there exists a power series L anzn having a radius of convergence ~ r and such that
for all z in the disc is said to admit a power series expansion on this disc. We shall now see that such a function is holomorphic, and that its derivative is given by the "obvious" power series. Indeed, define the formal derived series to be
Theorem 5.1. If f(z) = L anz n has radius of convergence r, then:
(i) The series L nanzn- l has the same radius of convergence. (ii) The function f is holomorphic on D(O, r), and its derivative is equal
to L nanzn- l.
Proof By Theorem 2.6, we have
lim sup lanl l /n= 1/r.
But
lim sup Inan Ilin = lim sup nl/n Ian Ilin.
Since lim nl/n = 1, the sequences
and
have the same lim sup, and therefore the series L anz n and L nanzn have the same radius of convergence. Then
and
converge absolutely for the same values of z, so the first part of the theorem is proved.
As to the second, let Izl < r, and b > °be such that Izl + b < r. We
consider complex numbers h such that
Ihl < b. We have
f(z + h) = L an(z + ht

where Pn(z, h) is a polynomial in z and h, with positive integer coefficients, in fact
Note that we have the estimate:
Subtracting series, we find

For Ihl < b, we have the estimate

This last expression is fixed, independent of h. Hence
As h approaches 0, the right-hand side approaches 0, and therefore
lim Ih L anPn(z, h)1 = 0.
h-+O
This proves that f is differentiable, and that its derivative at z is given by
the series I nanzn- 1, as was to be shown.
Remark. Conversely, we shall see after Cauchy's theorem that a function which is differentiable admits power series expansion-a very remarkable fact, characteristic of complex differentiability.
From the theorem, we see that the k-th derivative of f is given by the series


74 POWER SERIES [II, §5]
where hk is a power series without constant term. Therefore we obtain the standard expression for the coefficients of the power series in terms of the derivatives, namely
If we deal with the expansion at a point Zo, namely
then we find
It is utterly trivial that the formally integrated series
f ~zn+l
n=O n + 1
has radius of convergence at least r, because its coefficients are smaller in absolute value than the coefficients of f Since the derivative of this integrated series is exactly the series for j, it follows from Theorem 6.1 that the integrated series has the same radius of convergence as f Let j be a function on an open set U. If g is a holomorphic function on U such that g' = j, then g is called a primitive for f We see that a function which has a power series expansion on a disc always has a primitive on that disc. In other words, an analytic function has a local primitive at every point.
Example. The function liz is analytic on the open set U consisting of the plane from which the origin has been deleted. Indeed, for Zo =f: 0, we have the power series expansion

II, §6. THE INVERSE AND OPEN MAPPING THEOREMS
Let f be an analytic function on an open set U, and let f(U) = v. We
shall say that f is an analytic isomorphism if V is open and there exists an analytic function
g: V -+ U
such that fog = idv and g 0 f = idu , in other words, f and g are inverse functions to each other. We say that f is a local analytic isomorphism or is locally invertible at a point Zo if there exists an open set U containing Zo such that f is an analytic isomorphism on U.
Remark. The word "inverse" is used in two senses: the sense of §1, when we consider the reciprocal l/f of a function f, and in the current sense, which may be called the composition inverse, i.e. an inverse for the composite of mappings. The context makes clear which is meant. In this section, we mean the composition inverse.
Theorem 6.1.
(a) Let f(T) = a1 T + higher terms be a formal power series with a1 "# O. Then there exists a unique power series g(T) such that f(g(T» = T. This power series also satisfies g(f(T» = T. (b) If f is a convergent power series, so is g. (c) Let f be an analytic function on an open set U containing zoo Suppose that !'(zo) "# O. Then f is a local analytic isomorphism at zoo
Proof We first deal with the formal power series problem (a), and we find first a formal inverse for f(T). For convenience of notation below we write f(T) in the form
co
f(T) = a1 T - L an Tn.
n=2
We seek a power series
co
g(T) = L bnTn
n=1
such that
f(g(T» = T.
The solution to this problem is given by solving the equations in terms


[II, §6] THE INVERSE AND OPEN MAPPING THEOREMS 77
of the coefficients of the power series
These equations are of the form
and
where p" is a polynomial with positive integer coefficients (generalized binomial coefficients). In fact, one sees at once that
p"(a2' ... ,an' b1 , ... ,bn-d
= a2 P2,n(b1 , ••• ,bn-d + ... + anp",n(b1 , ••• ,bn-d,
where again Pt,n is a polynomial with positive coefficients. In this manner we can solve recursively for the coefficients
since bn appears linearly with coefficient a1 :F 0 in these equations, and the other terms do not contain bn • This shows that a formal inverse exists and is uniquely determined. Next we prove that g(f(T») = T. By what we have proved already,
there exists a power series h(T) = C1 T + higher terms with C1 :F 0 such that g(h(T») = T. Then using J(g(T») = T and g(h(T») = T, we obtain:
g(f(T») = g(f(g(h(T)))) = g(h(T») = T,
which proves the desired formal relation. Assume next that J is convergent. We must now show that g(z) is absolutely convergent on some disc. To simplify the number of symbols used, we assume that a1 = 1. This loses no generality, because if we find a convergent inverse power series for a11J(z), we immediately get the convergent inverse power series for J(z) itself.
Let J*(T) = T - L a:Tn
n<:;2
be a power series with a: real ~ 0 such that lanl ~ a: for all n. Let qJ(T) be the formal inverse of J*(T), so

with those same polynomials p" as before. By induction, it therefore follows that Cn is real ~ 0, and also that

since bn = p"(a2 , ... ,bn-d. It suffices therefore to pick the series f* so that it has an easily computed formal inverse ({J which is easily verified to have a positive radius of convergence. It is now a simple matter to carry out this idea, and we pick for f* a geometric series. There exists A > 0 such that for all n we have

The expression under the radical sign is of the form

We use the binomial expansion to find the square root of a series of the

form 1 + h(T) when h(T) has zero constant term. It is now clear that cp(T) is obtained by composition of convergent power series, and hence has a non-zero radius of convergence. This proves that the power series g(T) also converges.
Finally, for (c), suppose first that Zo = 0 and I(zo) = 0, so 1 is analytic
on an open set containing o. This means that 1 has a convergent power
series expansion at 0, so we view 1 as being defined on its open disc of convergence
I:D--+C.
Let Vo be an open disc centered at 0 such that Vo is contained in the disc of convergence of g, and such that g(Vo) c D. Such a neighborhood of 0 exists simply because g is continuous. Let Uo = 1-1(VO) be the set of all zED such that I(z) c Vo. Let
be the restriction of 1 to Uo. We claim that 10 is an analytic isomor
phism. Note that g(Vo) c Uo because for WE Vo we have I(g(w)) = W by Theorem 3.4, so we consider the restrictIon go of g to Vo as mapping
Again by Theorem 3.4, for Z E Uo we have go(Jo(z)) = z, which proves that 10 and go are inverse to each other, and concludes the proof of Theorem 6.1(c) in case Zo = 0 and I(zo) = O. The general case is reduced to the above case by translation, as one
says. Indeed, for an arbitrary I, with I(z) = L an(z - zo)", change variables and let
0()
W=z-zo, F(w) = I(z) - I(zo) = L anw n.
n=l
Then we may apply the previous special case to F and find a local inverse G for F. Let Wo = I(zo), and let
g(w) = G(w - wo) + zoo
Then g is a local inverse for I, thus finishing the proof of Theorem 6.1.
There are (at least) four ways of proving the inverse function theorem.
1. The way we have just gone through, by estimating the formal inverse to show that it converges.


80 POWER SERIES [II, §6]
2. Reproducing the real variable proof for real functions of class C1. By the contraction principle, (shrinking lemma), one first shows that the map is locally surjective, and one constructs a local inverse, which is shown to be differentiable, and whose derivative satisfies, for w = J(z), the relation
g'(W) = l/J'(z).
The reader should be able to copy the proof from any standard book on analysis, (certainly from my Undergraduate Analysis [La 83]).
3. Assuming the theorem for COO real functions. One can show (and we shall do so later when we discuss the real aspects of an analytic function) that an analytic function is Coo, as a function of (x, y), writing
z = x + iy.
The hypothesis J'(zo) =F 0 (namely a1 =F 0) is then seen to amount to the property that the Jacobian of the real function of two variables has nonzero determinant, whence J has a Coo inverse locally by the real theorem. It is then an easy matter to show by the chain rule that this inverse satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and is therefore holomorphic, whence analytic by the theory which follows Cauchy's theorem.
4. Giving an argument based on more complex function theory, and carried out in Theorem 1.7 of Chapter VI.
All four methods are important, and are used in various contexts in analysis, both of functions of one variable, and functions of several variables.
Let U be an open set and let J be a function on U. We say that J is an open mapping if for every open subset U' of U the image J(U') is open. Theorem 6.1 shows that the particular type of function considered there, i.e. with non-zero first coefficient in the power series expansion, is locally open. We shall now consider arbitrary analytic functions, first at the origin. Let
be a convergent non-constant power series, and let m = ord J, so that
J(z) = amzm+ higher terms,
= amzm(l + h(z»,


[II, §6] THE INVERSE AND OPEN MAPPING THEOREMS 81
where h(z) is convergent, and has zero constant term. Let a be a complex number such that am = am. Then we can write f(z) in the form
where h1 (z) is a convergent power series with zero constant term, obtained from the binomial expansion
(1 + h(z))l/m = 1 + h1(z),
and
f1(Z) = az{1 + h1(z)) = az + azh1(z)
is a power series whose coefficient of z is a =f. O. Theorem 6.1 therefore applies to f1 (z), which is therefore locally open at the origin. We have
f(z) = f1 (zt·
Let U be an open disc centered at the origin on which f1 converges. Then f1 (U) contains an open disc V. The image of V under the map
is a disc. Hence f(U) contains an open disc centered at the origin.
Theorem 6.2. Let f be analytic on an open set U, and assume that for each point of U, f is not constant on a given neighborhood of that point. Then f is an open mapping.
Proof We apply the preceding discussion to the power series expansion of f at a point of V, so the proof is obvious in the light of what we have already done.
The construction in fact yielded the following statement which it is worthwhile extracting as a theorem.
Theorem 6.3. Let f be analytic at a point zo,
00
f(z) = ao + L an(z - zot,
n=m
with m ~ 1 and am =f. O. Then there exists a local analytic isomorphism cp at 0 such that


82 POWER SERIES [II, §6]
We interpret Theorem 6.3 as follows. Let
IjJ:U~V
be an analytic isomorphism. We write w = ljJ(z). We may view IjJ as a change of coordinates, from the coordinate z to the coordinate w. In Theorem 6.3 we may therefore write
where w = cp(z - zo). The expansion for I in terms of the coordinate w is therefore much simpler than in terms of the coordinate z.
We also get a criterion for a function to have an analytic inverse on a whole open set.
Theorem 6.4. Let I be analytic on an open set U, and assume that I is injective. Let V = I(U) be its image. Then I: U ~ V is an analytic isomorphism, and I'(z) '# 0 lor all z E U.
Proof The function I between U and V is bijective, so we can define an inverse mapping g: V ~ U. Let Zo be a point of U, and let the power series expansion of I at Zo be as in Theorem 6.3. If m > 1 then we see that I cannot be injective, because the m-th power function in a neighborhood of the origin is not injective (it wraps the disc m times around). Hence m = 1, and Theorem 6.1 now shows that the inverse function g is analytic at I(zo). This proves the theorem.
Example 1. Let I(z) = 3 - 5z + higher terms. Then 1(0) = 3, and
1'(0) = al = -5 '# O.
Hence I is a local analytic isomorphism, or locally invertible, at O.
Example 2. Let I(z) = 2 - 2z + Z2. We want to determine whether I
is locally invertible at z = 1. We write the power series expansion of I at 1, namely I(z) = 1 + (z - 1)2 = 1 + a2(z - 1)2.
Here we have a1 = O. Hence I is not locally invertible at z = 1.
Example 3. Let I(z) = cos z. Determine whether I is locally invertible at z = O. In this case,
Z2
I(z) = 1 - "2 + higher terms,
so al = 0 and I is not locally invertible.


[II, §7] THE LOCAL MAXIMUM MODULUS PRINCIPLE 83
Example 4. Let f(z) = Z3. Then f'(z) = 3z2 and f'(0) = O. Thus f is not locally invertible at o. On the other hand, f'(z) i= 0 if z i= O. Hence if Zo i= 0 then f is locally invertible at zo. However, let U be the open
set obtained by deleting the origin from C. Then f is not invertible on U. (Why?)

II, §7. THE LOCAL MAXIMUM MODULUS PRINCIPLE
This principle is an immediate application of the open mapping theorem, and so we give it here, to emphasize its direct dependence with the preceding section. On the other hand, we wait for a later chapter for less

basic applications mostly for psychological reasons. We want to alternate the formal operations with power series and the techniques which will arise from Cauchy's theorem. The later chapter could logically be read almost in its entirety after the present section, however. We say that a function f is locally constant at a point Zo if there exists an open set D (or a disc) containing Zo such that f is constant on D.
Theorem 7.1. Let f be analytic on an open set U. Let Zo E U be a maximum for IfI, that is,
If(zo) I ~ If(z)l, for all z E U.
Then f is locally constant at Zo.
Proof. The function f has a power series expansion at zo,
If f is not the constant ao = f(zo), then by Theorem 6.2 we know that f is an open mapping in a neighborhood of zo, and therefore the image of f contains a disc D(ao, s) of radius s > 0, centered at ao. Hence the set
of numbers If(z) I, for z in a neighborhood of zo, contains an open interval around ao, so If(z) I > If(zo)1 for some z. Hence
cannot be a maximum for f, a contradiction which proves the theorem.
Corollary 7.2. Let f be analytic on an open set U, and let Zo E U be a maximum for the real part Re f, that is,
Re f(zo) ~ Re f(z), for all z E U.
Then f is locally constant at zo'
Proof The function ef(z) is analytic on U, and if
f(z) = u(z) + iv(z)
is the expression of f in terms of its real and imaginary parts, then
Hence a maximum for Re f is also a maximum for Ief(z) I, and the corollary follows from the theorem.


[II, §7] THE LOCAL MAXIMUM MODULUS PRINCIPLE 85
The theorem is often applied when 1 is analytic on an open set U
and is continuous at the boundary of U. Then a maximum for II(z) I necessarily occurs on the boundary of U. For this one needs that U is connected, and the relevant form of the theorem will be proved as Theorem 1.3 of the next chapter. We shall give here one more example of the power of the maximum modulus principle, and postpone to a later chapter some of the other applications.
Theorem 7.3. Let
be a polynomial, not constant, and say ad #- O. Then 1 has some com
plex zero, i.e. a number Zo such that I(zo) = o.
Proof. Suppose otherwise, so that l/l(z) is defined for all z, and defines an analytic function. Writing
one sees that
lim l/l(z) = O.

Let a be some complex number such that I(a) #- O. Pick a positive number R large enough such that lal < R, and if Izl ~ R, then

--<-
I/(z) I I/(a)I'
Let S be the closed disc of radius R centered at the origin. Then S is closed and bounded, and l/l/(z)1 is continuous on S, whence has a maximum on S, say at Zo' By construction, this point Zo cannot be on the boundary of the disc, and must be an interior point. By the maximum modulus principle, we conclude that l/l(z) is locally constant at zo. This is obviously impossible since 1 itself is not locally constant, say from the expansion
with suitable coefficients bo, ... ,bd and bd #- O. This proves the theorem.

Let [a, b] be a closed interval of real numbers. By a curve Y (defined on this interval) we mean a function

which we assume to be of class Cl.

We recall what this means. We write
where Yl is the real part of y, and Y2 is its imaginary part. For instance, the curve

is the unit circle. Of class Cl means that the functions Yl(t), Y2(t) have continuous derivatives in the ordinary sense of calculus. We have drawn

a curve in Fig. 1. Thus a curve is a parametrized curve. We cally(a) the beginning point, and y(b) the end point of the curve. By a point on the curve we mean a point w such that w = y(t) for some t in the interval of definition of y.
We define the derivative y'(t) in the obvious way, namely
y'(t) = Yl (t) + iy2(t).
It is easily verified as usual that the rules for the derivative of a sum, product, quotient, and chain rule are valid in this case, and we leave this as an exercise. In fact, prove systematically the following statements: Let F: [a, b] -+ C and G: [a, b] -+ C be complex valued differentiable functions, defined on the same interval. Then:
(F + G)' = F' + G',
(FG)' = FG' + F'G,
(FIG)' = (GF' - FG')/G 2
(this quotient rule being valid only on the set where G(t) =F 0). Let t/I: [c, d] -+ [a, b] be a differentiable function. Then yo t/I is differentiable, and
(y 0 t/I)'(t) = y'(t/I(t»)t/I'(t),
as illustrated on Fig. 2(i).

Finally suppose y is a curve in an open set U and
f: U-+C
is a holomorphic function. Then the composite f 0 y is differentiable (as a function of the real variable t) and
(f 0 y)'(t) = !'(y(t»)y'(t),
