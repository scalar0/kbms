1 Atom-field interaction. Semiclassical theory
We start with consideration of a basic problem in our course: the interaction of electromagnetic field with quantum system. In the following we will refer to such system as an ”atom”. The word semiclassical in this context means that we treat electromagnetic field classical, but describe atom as a quantum system. We start with a two-level system (see Fig. 1) as a simplest but very rich example of light-matter interaction.

Figure 1: The energy system of two-level atom.
We assume that the electron in the system is initially in the ground state, and at time moment t = 0 it is excited with a plane wave with polarization E and wavevector k = ω/c. Let us find the probability of atom to be in the excited state at time moment t. In the suggested formulation the problem is a typical example from quantum mechanics
course. One should start with writing down the Hamiltonian ̂H0 of an electron in the system without electric field :
̂H0 = ̂p2
2m + ̂V (r). (1.1)
Here ̂p is the momentum operator, and ̂V is the potential energy of the electron. One can find the eigen states and energy levels of the atom:
̂H0 |ψ〉 = E |ψ〉 . (1.2)
In the following we will assume that there are two eigen states, which we define as |a〉 and |b〉 (ground state) with energies Ea and Eb correspondingly. Their difference gives the energy of atomic transition ħω0 = Ea − Eb. The Hamiltonian of the system after introducing the electromagnetic field is as follows:
̂H = (pˆ − e
c A)2
2m + Vˆ (r) − eφ. (1.3)
NB: Potentials are not determined uniquely, and gauge transformation may take place:
A → A + ħc
e ∇χ, φ → φ − ħc
e
∂χ
∂t , (1.4)
wehre χ(r, t) is a real-valued function of coordinate and time. Then the wave function should also be transformed.
ψ → ψeiχ(r,t). (1.5)

Next, we write down a vector potential describing the incident plane wave:
A = A0eikr−iωt = A0(t)eikr. (1.6)
Assuming that characteristic scale of the system L is much smaller than the wavelength
L λ (1.7)
one can expanding A near r0 (the radius-vector of atom center) in Taylor series:
A(r, t) ≈ A0(t)eikr0 (1 + ikρ) ≈ A0eikr0. (1.8)
So the vector potential does not change in space, but in time. By choosing the coordinate so that r0 = 0 one can simplify the system even further A ≈ A0(t):
Hˆ = 1
2m
(
pˆ − e
c A0(t)
)2
+ V (r) + eφ. (1.9)
The standard choice it to use Coulomb gauge:
div A = 0, φ = 0. (1.10)
After that, using pˆ = −iħ∇, we obtain
Hˆ = − ħ2
2m
(
∇ − ie

+ V (r). (1.11)
Our goal is to find out the temporal evolution of the system. This is can be done by solving the Schr ̈odinger equation:
̂H ψ = iħ ∂ψ
∂t
First of all, we simplify the Hamiltonian by introducing a new wave function ψ ̃ =
ψ e−i e
cħ A0r
} {{ }
↪→=u
. This substitution and related unitary transformation ̂H → u† ̂H u will make
an momentum shift ˆp − e/cA → pˆ. Indeed, if one recalls that
(∇ − ig) (∇ − ig) ψ ̃eigr = = (∇ − ig)
(

eigr =

where g d=ef e

The second component in the lefthand side is the interaction term, which appeared after transformation of the Hamiltonian. By its form one can treat is as a dipole energy in the electric field, and we will define Hˆ1
d=ef −d · E, and d d=ef −er is the dipole moment. This, finally, leads us to a simplified form of the Schro ̈dinger equation (we omit the tilde sign here to avoid additional idle symbols):
(
̂H0 + ̂H1
) ψ ̃ = iħ∂ψ ̃
∂t . (1.16)
In order to solve this equation one can apply the expansion of |ψ〉 over the eigenstates
of non-perturbed system:
∣ ∣ ∣
ψ ̃
〉
= Ca(t) |a〉 + Cb(t) |b〉 , (1.17)
where
Hˆ0 |a〉 = Ea |a〉 , Hˆ0 |b〉 = Eb |b〉 . (1.18)
NB: Here we switch to ”bra” and ”ket” respresentation.
We recall that Ea − Eb = ħω0 is the transition frequency. We assume that the incident
field has following time dependence E = E0 cos ωt, so Hˆ1 = −d · E. Let us assume that initially the system is in the ground state in accordance with the formulation of the problem:
∣ ∣ ∣
ψ ̃
〉∣ ∣
∣t=0
= |b〉 → Ca(0) = 0,
Cb(0) = 1. (1.19)
Then one can rewrite the equation in the form:
(EaCa |a〉 + EbCb |b〉) − d · E Ca |a〉 − d · E Cb |b〉 = iħC ̇ a |a〉 + iħC ̇ b |b〉 . (1.20)
Projecting it over |a〉 and |b〉 one can get:

 
 
〈a| · (1.20) : EaCa − Ca 〈a| d · ε |a〉 − Cb 〈a| d · ε |b〉 = iħC ̇ a,
〈b| · (1.20) : EbCb − Cb 〈b| d · ε |b〉 − Ca 〈b| d · ε |a〉 = iħC ̇ b.
(1.21)
In the dipole approximation the field E does not change in space, so we can write
〈a| d · E |a〉 = 〈a| d |a〉 · E, 〈a| d · E |b〉 = 〈a| d |b〉 · E. (1.22)
This allows one to introduce dipole matrix elements:
dαβ
d=ef 〈α| d |β〉 =
∫
dV ψ∗
α(r)erψβ(r) α, β = a, b. (1.23)
By symmetry considerations it follows |dαα| |dαβ|α6=β, since normally neighbouring
states have opposite parity, and er is the odd function. Basing on this, we set daa, dbb → 0 in (1.21), and we can write
{
iħC ̇ a = EaCa − Cbdab · E,
iħC ̇ b = EbCb − Cadba · E. dba = d∗
ab (1.24)
Here we can see that if we ”turn off” the interaction (dαβ = 0) states |a〉 and |b〉 will be unloosened. If we turn the interaction on transitions will take place. To get rid off phase factor we introduce
C ̃a(t) d=ef Ca(t)e− i
ħ Eat, C ̃b(t) d=ef Cb(t)e− i
ħ Ebt. (1.25)

After that we have 

   
 ̇
C ̃a = i
ħ dab · Eeiω0tC ̃b(t),
 ̇
C ̃b = i
ħ d∗
ab · Ee−iω0tC ̃a(t).
(1.26)
Now we need to apply rotating wave approximation (RWA). To understand what is it lets look at
E(t)eiω0t = E0
eiωt + e−iωt
2 eiω0t = 1
2 E0

 ei(ω0+ω)t
} {{ }
fastly oscillating
+ei(ω0−ω)t

 . (1.27)
Fast oscillating term will lead to a small contribution, so it may be neglected. Leaving only ∼ ei(ω0−ω)t term is called RWA. It is convenient to denote ∆ d=ef ω0 − ω, which is the frequency of detuning between the excitation frequency and atomic transition frequency, which gives us:

   
   
 ̇
C ̃a = i
2ħ dab · E0ei∆tC ̃b(t),
 ̇
C ̃b = i
2ħ d∗
ab · E0e−i∆tC ̃a(t).
(1.28)
One can see that there is pronounced coupling between the ground and excited state, which is defined by constant
ΩR
d=ef |dab · E0|
ħ , (1.29)
which is called Rabi frequency. Its real part gives the strength of coupling between the states. To illustrate our result one can consider zero detuning case ∆ = 0 (resonant excitation) and a specific phase of incident light:

   
   
 ̇
C ̃a = i ΩR
2
C ̃b,
 ̇
C ̃b = i ΩR
2
C ̃a.
(1.30)
The solution for given initial conditions (1.19) is easy to obtain: C ̃b = i cos ( ΩRt
2
) , C ̃a =
i sin ( ΩRt
2
). The squared amplitudes of the coefficients |Ca|2 and |Cb|2 have the real physical meaning of the probability of occupation on excited and ground states respectively. NB: There are couple of very simple but illustrative conclusion one can make:
1. If d ⊥ E, then ΩR = 0 and there is no coupling between the two states;
2. To increase Rabi frequency one needs to increase the amplitude of incident wave |E0|;
3. The inversion population oscillates with period 2π
ΩR
, however the wavefunction, which
describes the quantum state is periodic with 4π
ΩR
;
4. There is no spontaneous emission in the system. If one turns out the field at time moment t then the system will remain in its state.

2. Consider a TLS from the first lecture. Assume that at time moment t = 0 the system was in ground state, and it was excited by a finite optical pulse given by an amplitude envelope: E0(t) = Eenv(t) cos(ωt),
where Eenv(t) is a slowly varying function. Please, formulate the condition for the envelope function, which ensure that the system will be in the inversed population state after the pulse has passed.
3. (6 pts) Consider a two-level system with non-zero diagonal elements of dipole transition operator:

Using semiclassical approach generalize the RWA (Rotating wave approximation) for this case and find the expression for “new” Rabi frequency.

Isidor Isaac Rabi (29 July 1898 - 11 January 1988)
I encourage you to add some bio here. On you taste :)
Wiki: ”In 1942 Oppenheimer attempted to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher to work at the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project.[52] Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of TNT equivalent (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.”

2 Density matrix of two energy level system
We continue the consideration of a TLS started previous lecture. In Section 1 we obtained the dynamics of a TLS, showing Rabi oscillations. There is no need to stress that any dissipative forces were omitted in that consideration. This results in a conclusion that turning off the incident field will make the system to ”freeze” in the final state forever (see Fig. 4). This contradicts with the well-known effect of spontaneous relaxation, happening in the real life. One could add a phenomenological dissipative terms to dynamical system Eq. (1.30), but this will ruin the wavefunction and it’s normalization, as we change the final equations but not the Hamiltonian of the system. In the framework of semiclassical consideration the only correct way out is to use density matrix formalism.

A density matrix is a matrix that describes a quantum system in a mixed state, a statistical ensemble of several quantum states. In other words, density matrix is very useful if we do not know a wave function which contains all the information of the system but we still want to describe our system. We illustrate this with two very typical examples (fig. 5):
1. |ψA〉 is known but we need to describe only B-system which is a subsystem of A. This means that though the system is in a pure quantum mechanical state, we might not always can describe the subsystem B with any particular wavefunction.
2. B — is not a conservative system, and there is an interaction with energy exchanging with the outer system (reservoir) is taking place. We do not know the exact mechanism of this interaction, and, thus, can not build a proper wavefunction. But still can give some assumptions on that.
NB: If a state can be described by a particular wavefunction, then we call it ”pure” state
If |ψ〉 is known than density matrix is defined by
ρˆ = |ψ〉 〈ψ| (2.1)
If we expand to Fock states |ψ〉 = ∑ Cn |n〉 then

Example: Density matrix for two-level system.
For a two-level system considered in the first lecture we have:
|ψ〉 = Ca |a〉 + Cb |b〉 , (2.3)
so
ρˆ = |ψ〉 〈ψ| =

This is the main intended use of density matrix! Properties:
1. Hermiticity: ρˆ† = ρˆ.
2. Tr ρˆ = 1 → diagonal elements: ρmn = |Cn|2. Remark: only for pure states!
3. ] ρˆ = |ψ〉 〈ψ| → ρˆ2 = ρˆ. It’s easy to show:

〈ψ| = |ψ〉 〈ψ| . (2.6)
It also means that density matrix of pure state is a projector.
2.1 Density matrix of a subsystem
Let fˆA is an operator that acts only in subsystem A. Now let us ask a question: how
to find mean value f ̄A?
13


Subsystem A does not have its own wave function and |ψ〉 (wave function of A + B) does not fall in multiplication of |ψA〉 and |ψB〉. But we can write an expansion in eigenfunctions |n〉 of subsystem A and |α〉 of B:
|ψ〉 =
∑
nα
Cnα |n〉 |α〉 . (2.7)
Now we can write
f ̄A = 〈ψ| fˆA |ψ〉 =

or in other words (ρˆA)n′n =

In the general case:

Now let us consider a mixed state. Let there are lots of systems in different pure states |ψi〉. Let there are Ni particles in |ψi〉, then the whole amount of particles (=systems) is N = ∑ Ni. The probabily to find any system in |ψi〉 is wi = Ni
N . The question we are trying to answer now: how can we find mean operator value?
f ̄ = Tr ρˆfˆ =? since ρˆ =? (2.12)
Scenario is the following:
1. Calculation of quantum-average values: fi = 〈ψi| fˆ|ψi〉.
2. Calculation of classical average values: f ̄ = ∑ wifi.
So

2.3 Density matrix of a two-level system
Let us consider a TLS with upper state |a〉 with energy Ea = ħωa and lower |b〉 with Eb = ħωb shown in Fig. ??. Wave function of such system is

2.4 Bloch sphere
There is an easy-to-see way to visualize the state of a two-level system. First of all, while we are considering the a system in a pure state we have only two independent parameters because of the additional restictions conditions applied for the density matrix. It appears that it is convenient to introduce the following variables:

 
 
x = 2 Re ρab
y = 2 Im ρab
z = ρaa − ρbb
(2.27)
These coordinates form a new vector r = {x, y, z}. There are several properties of this vector:
16


• if the system is in the pure state, then the |r| = 1 and the vector’s end lies on the sphere, which is often called Bloch’s sphere. This is a consequence of the relation |r|2 = Tr(ρˆ2);
• by the definition, z-coordinate shows the inverse population of the system;
• one can show, that the system (2.30) can be rewritten in the form of
r ̇ = [Ω × r] , (2.28)
where Ω is the vector of precession (see Homework).
2.5 Dissipations
We recall that one of the main reasons, which stimulated us to consider the density matrix, was the potential possibility of introducing the losses and dissipation processes in the system. This can be done phenomenologically or more rigorously using relaxation theory (see Scully&Zubairy for the details). The simplified conclusion of this rigorous approach can be formulate in a general form of recipe of adding the losses through the dissipation operator Γˆ:
ρˆ ̇ = − i
ħ
[Hˆ, ρˆ
]
−1
2
{ˆΓ, ρˆ
}
, (2.29)
where Γmn = γnδmn, γn is the dissipation rate constants. However, this is not the only way how one can introduce the dissipation terms.
2.5.1 Spontaneous emission of TLS
With the density matrix tool one can introduce the process of spontaneous emission for describing the TLS. This can be done by adding the necessary terms in the right-hand side of the master equation. As soon as we want to describe the spontaneous decay of the excited state, we should add a terms −γ1ρaa in the equation describing the dynamics of the upper state population given by ρaa. In order to conserve the total probability, one should add the same term to the equation for ρbb. We will also add a rate of coherence dissipation defined by the constant γ2

    
    
ρ ̇aa = −i ΩR
2 (ρ ̃ab − ρ ̃ba) − γ1ρaa,
ρ ̇bb = −ρ ̇aa.  ̇
ρ ̃ab = −i∆ρ ̃ab + i ΩR
2 (ρbb − ρaa) − γ2ρ ̃ab,  ̇
ρ ̃ba = (  ̇
ρ ̃ab)∗.
(2.30)
The introduced dissipation rates γ1 and γ2 are often referred to inversion population decay and coherence decay (dephasing) rates respectively. The are also often called longitudinal and transverse damping constants, the reason for this notation will be clear later. The inversion population rate has quite simple origin and can be related to many processes, which can be divided into radiative (spontaneous emission) and non-radiative(relaxation through phonon interaction or any other non-radiating channel): γ1 = γr
1 + γnr
1 . The decoherence rate is, actually, more complicated process and it can not be lower that doubled inversion population decay rate:
γ2 = 2γ1 + γ′
2.

Figure 7: The trajectory of the state on the Bloch sphere for two cases: γ′
2 γ1 strong transverse damping (1-2’), γ′′
2 γ1 strong longitudinal damping (1-2”).
This illustrates the fact that the inversion population results in decoherence of the quantum state. On the other hand, the factor γ′
2 corresponds to so-called pure dephasing time, which is not necessarily is related to population decay. Finally, all the relaxation processes result in the destroying of the pure quantum states and transferring it into the mixed state. This can be very easily illustrated with the help of the Bloch sphere. We consider two distinct cases:
1. γ′
2 γ1 corresponds to pure dephasing process. In this cases the population inversion stays constant at this time scales, and the relaxation process occurs with z ≈ const and the vector has only transverse dynamics (see Fig. 7 1-2’).
2. γ1 γ′
2 corresponds to dynamics with varying all the coordinates. The final state corresponds to the ground state as show in Fig. 7 1-2” trajectory.
Note, that in both cases the vector leaves the surface and goes inside the sphere, which is a sign of an incoherence, and the system transfers switches into a mixed state.
2.6 Dielectric constant of media
The proposed picture of a TLS interaction with classical field based on density matrix gives a powerful tool for analyzing large quantum systems consisting of many atoms. This allows, in particular, to build a proper description of lasing. But here we will consider another important example of deriving the dielectric susceptibility of a media by considering it as an ensemble of identical TLS. From classical electrodynamics one knows that susceptibility is a constant, which ties together polarization vector P and electric amplitude vector E:
P = χE.
18


At the same time, the polarization vector is a dipole moment of a unit volume, which can be calculated basing on the quantum mechanical approach. The time-varying polarization can be obtained by averaging the dipole moment of a TLS using the density matrix of the system:
P ̃ (t) = N Tr(ρˆ(t)dˆ) = N (ρabd∗
ab + ρbadab), (2.31)
here N is the concentration of atoms in media. On the other hand temporal dependence of P ̃ (t) can be expanded in two counter-rotating terms:
P ̃ (t) = Pe−iωt + P∗eiωt, (2.32)
which gives us that P = N ρ ̃abd∗
ab. Now, in order to derive the expression for polarization tensor one should consider the stationary regime, which forms in TLS after applying external harmonic field excitation. This can be easily done by assuming ρ ̇ˆ → 0 in Eq. (2.30), which results in

    
    
ρaa = −i ΩR
2γ1
(
ρ ̃ab − ρ ̃ba)
ρ ̃ab = i ΩR
2(γ2 + i∆) (ρbb − ρaa)
(2.33)
Using the properties of the density matrix, we get ρbb − ρaa = 1 − 2ρaa = 1 + iΩR
γ1
(
ρ ̃ab −
ρ ̃ba). After some simple algebra, one obtains:
ρbb − ρaa = 1 − Ω2
Rγ2
γ1(γ2
2 + ∆2) (ρbb − ρaa),
which, finally, gives us:
ρbb − ρaa = γ2
2 + ∆2
γ2
2 + ∆2 + Ω2
Rγ2

and
ρ ̃ab = 1
2
ΩR(∆ + iγ2)
γ2
2 + ∆2 + Ω2
Rγ2
γ1
. (2.35)
Now, recalling the definition of Rabi frequency ΩR = dabE/ħ, we can write down the expression for χ:
χ(ω) = |dab|2((ω0 − ω) + iγ2)
2ħ
(
(ω0 − ω)2 + γ2
2 + Ω2
Rγ2
γ1
) . (2.36)
The obtained expression for χ(ω) demonstrates two very important features:
• Any quantum dipole transition gives a resonant response in material constants of media.
• Any TLS is highly nonlinear material. Indeed, as Ω2
R ∼ E2, then the susceptibility is a function of field intensity. Moreover, at the resonance the imaginary part Im(χ), responsible for absorption has following expression:
Im(χ(ω)) = |dab|2γ1
2ħ (γ1γ2 + Ω2
R).

3 Secondary quantization
The discussed semi-classical approach is a powerful method for description of lightmatter interaction. It allows explanation of many complex physical effects. By adding classical fluctuation into the semi-classical system can cover a bigger part of quantum optics [Mandel]. However, there are several important effects, which can not be explained in terms of semi-classical approach. Spontaneous emission of excited atom is one of them, though it lies in the fundamentals of many physical systems. In order to understand this and other purely quantum effects, one needs to introduce a quantum of electromagnetic field, which are photons, or, in other words, one should quantize field. In order to do that, we will follow the standart method of field quantization and start from wave nature of electromagnetic field.

We will work with vector potential A, which can be introduced as follows:
H = rot A (3.2)
E = −1
c
∂A
∂t − ∇φ, (3.3)
where φ is the scalar electric potential. The vector and scalar potential can be defined in non-unique way up to the gradient of an arbitrary real function and time derivative of the same function, which often called “calibration freedom”. In order to eliminate this uncertainty in A and φ we apply additional restriction (Lorentz gauge):
div A = 0. (3.4)
Substituting the electric field expression to the (3.1b) gives
rot rot A = − 1

3.2 Field in the box, harmonics expansion, and the energy of
the electromagnetic field
After we set the equation for vector potential, we can build its solution for a very simple yet very important case. Let us consider a cube box with the length of the edge L (Fig. 8) with periodic boundary conditions. Such a box can interpret a free space once the limit L → ∞ will be applied. The solution of (3.9) may be written as a sum of all eigen solutions, which are the plane waves in Cartesian system. Taking into the account periodic boundary that results in
A(r, t) =
∑
k
Ak(t)eikr, kα = 2πnα
L , α = x, y, z nα ∈ Z. (3.10)
• The vector potential A(r, t) is real valued that provides the condition:
Ak(t) = A∗
−k(t) (3.11)
• The temporal dependence of the vector potential is described by two oscillating terms: Ak(t) = cke−iωkt + c∗
−keiωkt, (3.12)
where ωk = ck = c√kx2 + ky2 + kz2. The form of Ak(t) is provided by the condition (3.11).
• The Lorentz gauge leads to the fact that the waves are transverse:
div A = 0 → ∑
kAkeikr = 0 ⇐⇒ Ak(t) · k = 0. (3.13)
Consider a wave with wave vector k. According to Maxwell equations, there are two independent polarizations, so we introduce two transverse polarization vectors (see Fig. 8

k · eks = 0, [ek1 × e∗

(3.14)

A ̃k
(uks [k × eks] eikr − u∗

The obtained plane-wave expansion allows us to get a simple picture of EM field as an ensemble of oscillators. It is very illustrative to consider the energy of EM field inside the box:
H= 1
8π
∫
(H2 + E2) dV. (3.18)
We will simplify this further by using several important relations. First is the orthogonality of the modes:
∫
L3
ei(k−k′)rdV = L3δkk′ . (3.19)
This feature vanish the ∑
k. Second, it is convenient to notice that
e∗
ks · eks′ = δss′ → [k × e∗
ks] · [k × eks′] = k2δss′. (3.20)
Then, we get
H = L3

With this we see that electric and magnetic counterparts give equal contribution into the total EM energy. We split the real and imaginary parts of the mode amplitude |uks| by introducing new variables
qks(t) = uks(t) + u∗
ks(t), (3.23)
pks(t) = −iωk (uks(t) − u∗
ks(t)) . (3.24)

. (3.27)
This picture is indeed very illustrative as represent the Hamiltonian of the field as a sum of harmonic oscillators energies.
3.3 Field quantization
The field quantization procedure bases on the quantum-to-classical correspondence principe: we obtain the classical expression, and then quantize it by assuming that physical fields become operators. In our case, we see that the system can be considered as a set of harmonic oscillators, and H ∼ p2/2 + ω2q2/2, one can correspond quantum operators of coordinate and momentum to classical ones:
{
qks → qˆks,
pks → pˆks. (3.28)
We know, that in any quantum oscillator the coordinate and momentum can not commute. Thus, the introduced operators should also satisfy the same commutation relations:
[qˆks; pˆk′s′] = iħδ(3)
kk′ δss′ , (3.29)
[qˆks; qˆk′s′] = [pˆks; pˆk′s′] = 0. (3.30)
These operators should also correspond to measurable quantity and, thus, should be hermitian: qˆks = qˆ†
ks, pˆks = pˆ†
ks. (3.31)
Relations (3.29), (3.30) and (3.31) impose conditions for qˆks and pˆks. Then, our Hamiltonian acquires operator form
H −→ ̂H =
∑
k,s
( pˆ2
ks
2 + ω2
kqˆ2
ks
2
)
.
In order to further simplify the Hamiltonian and consideration in general, it is convenient to introduce the ladder operators:
aˆks(t) = 1
√2ħω (ωqˆks + ipˆks) , (3.32)
and his conjugated friend
aˆ†
ks(t) = 1
√2ħω (ωqˆks − ipˆks) . (3.33)
24


This leads to the useful representation of qˆks and pˆks:
qˆks(t) =
√ħ
2ω
(
aˆ†
ks + ˆaks
)
, (3.34)
pˆks(t) = i
√ ħω
2
(
aˆ†
ks − aˆks
)
. (3.35)
Commutation relations can be easily derived from consideration [qˆks; pˆks] in the representation of ladder operators and using (3.29) and (3.30). So we get
[
aˆk,s; aˆ†
k′,s′
]
= δ(3)
kk′δss′. (3.36)
Easy to show that Hamiltonian can be written as follows
Hˆ =
∑
k,s
ħωk
[
aˆ†
k,saˆk,s + 1
2
]
. (3.37)
It’s convenient to rewrite coefficients uˆks and uˆ+
ks as
uˆks = 1
2
(
qˆks − 1
iωk
pˆks
)
=
√ħ
2ωk
aˆks, (3.38)
uˆ+
ks =
√ħ
2ωk
aˆ+
ks. (3.39)
Now, we can quantize the electric potential and introduce the operator A → Aˆ such that:
ˆA =
∑
k,s
Ak
(aˆksekseikr + h.c. ) , Ak =
√ 2πħc2
L3ω . (3.40)
Finally we can write field operators:
ˆE =
∑
k,s
εk
(iaˆksekseikr + e.c. ) , εk =
√ 2πħωk
L3 , (3.41)
ˆH =
∑
k,s
Ak
(iaˆks [k × eks] eikr + e.c. ) . (3.42)
Remark: Electric field E satisfies wave equation E = 0 at the same time. We could quantize it:
E=
∑
εk
[aˆkekseikr + c.c. ] , (3.43)
H=
∑
Ak
[−iaˆk [k × eks] eikr + c.c. ] . (3.44)

Another important operator is of quantity of particles nˆks = aˆ†
ksaˆks in ks mode:
ˆnks |nks〉 = nks |nks〉 . (3.46)
Another import remark: |nks〉 — it is a state with wave vector k and state s which has exactly n photos.
Let us make things more clear, by discussing a bit about denotations:
|nks〉 ←→ ψks
n (x). (3.47)
Besides, any wave function can decomposed on the basis (if the basis is full):
ψ(x) =
∑
Cnφn(x), (3.48)
so it’s equivalent
ψ(x) ←→

3.5 Fields’ fluctuation
Let consider single mode field:
Eˆx(0) = εaˆ + ε∗aˆ†. (3.52)
Let’s compute the average field:
〈n| Eˆx |n〉 = ε 〈n| aˆ |n〉 + e.c. = 0, (3.53)
because 〈n| aˆ |n〉 = √n〈n|n − 1〉 = 0.
26


The average of Eˆ2 gives us the following
〈n| Eˆ2
x |n〉 = |ε|2 〈n| aˆˆa† |n〉+|ε|2 〈n| aˆ†aˆ |n〉 = 2 |ε|2 〈n| ˆn+ 1
2 |n〉 = 2 |ε|2
(
n+ 1
2
)
. (3.54)
Here we can make a few conclusions: a) the average field is zero for any Fock state; b) in vacuum state (n = 0) fluctuations are minimal, but not zero!
A standard calculation procedure of fluctuation of any variable X in |n〉 state is the following:
∆X =
√
〈n| Xˆ 2 |n〉 − 〈n| Xˆ |n〉2. (3.55)

4 Coherent states
We have already noticed that the Fock states forming a full orthogonal set of function in Hilbert space sometimes lack of physical meaning. In particular, they provide a zero average value of electric field operator ˆE. In this lecture we build an alternative set of wave functions, which will acquire the deep physical meaning by the end of the lecture and are called coherent states.
4.1 Eigenstates of anihilation operator
The problem with measuring the value of the electric field at the Fock states starts with the problem that the ladder operators in the basis of Fock states have no diagonal elements. The matrix of the ˆa operator has the form:
〈m| aˆ |n〉 =

      
0 √1 0 · · · 0 · · ·
0 0 √2 · · · 0 · · · ... ... . . . . . . ... · · ·
0 ... · · · 0 √n · · · ... ... ... ... ... . . .

      
. (4.1)
This problem can be overcome if we will switch to the basis of eigen functions of the anihilation operator:
aˆ |α〉 = α |α〉 .
where α is the eigenvalue. Our task is to construct these states |α〉, so we start with expanding them over the Fock states basis:
|α〉 =
∞
∑
n=0
cn |n〉 .
By substituting the expansion into the eigen equation, one gets
aˆ |α〉 =
∞
∑
n=0
cnaˆ |n〉 =

cn
√n |n − 1〉 =

which gives the recurrent relation
cn+1
√n + 1 = cnα → cn = αn
√n! c0 → |α〉 = c0
∞
∑
n=0
αn
√n! |n〉 .
The constant c0 can be found from the normalization condition:
〈α|α〉 = 1 → 1 = |c0|2

and finally
|α〉 = e−|α|2/2eiφ
∞
∑
n=0
αn
√n! |n〉 . (4.4)
NB: We put the phase φ = 0 as a wave function can be defined only up to a arbitrary phase factor. The obtained states are called the coherent states. Before going further lets discuss some of their main properties.
28


4.2 Basic properties of coherent states
• How many photons are there in coherent state?
The average number of photons in the coherent state |α〉 can be calculated as follows:
n = 〈α| aˆ†aˆ |α〉 .
From the definition of coherent states
ˆa |α〉 = α |α〉 ,
〈α| aˆ† = α∗ 〈α| ,
it immediately follows n = |α|2 . (4.5)
• But how the photons are distributed? The probability to find n photons in the state |α〉 state is given by the probability:
pn = |〈n|α〉|2 = e−|α|2 |α|2n
n! . (4.6)
In expression Eq. 4.6 one can recognize the Poisson distribution with average number of photons |α|2. According to the properties of Poisson distribution the dispersion
∆n = |α| ∼ √n and relative fluctuations of photon number is proportional to
∆n/n ∼ √n average number of photons (Fig. 9). The distribution of photons in a coherent state is shown in Fig.9 for different n average number of photons in a coherent state.
• Are the coherent states orthogonal or not?
The answer can be given by direct computation of the scalar product:
〈α′|α〉 = e−|α|2/2e−|α′|2/2 ∑ (α∗ ′)nαn
n! = e− 1
2 |α|2 e− 1
2 |α′|2 e
α∗′α 6= 0, ⇒
|〈α′|α〉|2 = e−|α−α′|2. (4.7)
So the coherent states are not orthogonal, but the amplitude norm of the scalar product exponentially depends on the ”distance” between the eigen numbers according to (4.7). For instance, it is very illustrative to consider the following example.
Example:
Consider two states with average number of photon equal to n = 5 (see Fig.9 (b)). Though the average number of photons in each of them is equal, their scalar product can be quite small:
|α〉 = |3 + 4i〉
|α′〉 = |4 + 3i〉 → |〈α′|α〉|2 = e−2 ≈ 0.1
|α〉 = |3 + 4i〉
|α′〉 = |−4 − 3i〉 → |〈α′|α〉|2 = e−98.
So, effectively, in the latter case one can assume that they are orthogonal.

4.3 Classical field
Let us come back to the problem of the average electric field computation and recall that being computed at the Fock states it gives zero value. The situation becomes different for the coherent states. Indeed, consider a single mode field given by the operator:
ˆE = ε (aˆeeikr−ωt + h. c.) . (4.8)
The average value at the coherent state will be as follows:
E = 〈α| ˆE |α〉 = εαeeikr−ωt + c. c. d=ef E+(r, t) + E−(r, t). (4.9)
The resulting value is a sum of two vector fields corresponding to the plane waves propagating in opposite direction. This is a classical coherent monochromatic field, which we are used to. The amplitude and phase of the field is defined by the complex value α:
E+ = E+eeikr−ωt, E+ = αε, ε =
√ 2πħ
V ω . (4.10)
The intensity is proportional to
I+ ∝ |E+|2 = ε2 |α|2 = ε2n, (4.11)
30


whilethe complex field amplitude also contains the phase φ
E+ = ε |α| eiφ. (4.12)
Thus, the coherent state realizes the quantum state, which behaves in a very similar manner to classical field. But this can be understood already at the level of the coherent state definition. Since we have aˆ |α〉 = α |α〉 , (4.13)
then number of photons in the system does not change under the action of the anihilation operator. In the next lecture we will see that the ˆa operator is responsible for detecting (measuring) photons. In classical physics the action of the measuring field does not change the state of the field, and this is exactly what we have for coherent states contrary to Fock states, where anihilation operator changes the number of photons |n〉 → |n + 1〉

4.4 Fluctuations
The “classical” behaviour of the coherent state is also expressed in the level of the fluctuations, which as low as any quantum state may have. In this paragraph we will elaborate more on that comparing the fluctuations of the coherent states with the Fock states. We start with a recalling the generalized momentum and coordinate operators:
pˆ = i
√ ħω
2
(aˆ† − aˆ) , qˆ =
√ħ
2ω
(aˆ† + ˆa) . (4.14)
The general Heisenberg relation tells us that ∆p∆q ≥ ħ
2 , but now we apply it for Fock
and coherent states.
Fock states
To find the fluctuations amplitude let us compute
p = 〈n| pˆ|n〉 = 0, q = 〈n| qˆ|n〉 = 0,
and
p2 = 〈n| pˆ2 |n〉 = ħω
2 (2n + 1) ,
q2 = 〈n| qˆ2 |n〉 = ħ
2ω (2n + 1) .

p2 − p2 =
√ ħω

√(2n + 1),
∆qn =

q2 − q2 =

√(2n + 1).
Now we can rewrite the uncertainty principle as following
∆pn∆qn = ħ
2 (2n + 1) . (4.15)
We need to stress here, that the amplitude of the fluctuation increase with increasing the number of photons in the state. In the phase space the Fock state can be represented by a circle with the centre at the origin and radius increasing with the number of photons in the state (as shown in Fig. 10 (a)).
Coherent states
In a similar manner, we can obtain the fluctuations of the coherent states. For the reasons we have already discussed the average value of the momentum and coordinate operator are non-zero and correspond to imaginary and real part of the eigen value α:
p = 〈α| pˆ|α〉 = i
√ ħω
2 (α∗ − α) = 2
√ ħω
2 Im {α} ,
q=2
√ħ
2ω Re {α} ,
The dispersion can be obtained from the following expression:
p2 = − ħω
2 〈α| aˆ†2 − aˆ†aˆ − aˆaˆ† + ˆa2 |α〉 = ħω
2 (4 Im {α} + 1) , (4.16)
32


q2 = ħ
2ω (4 Re {α} + 1) . (4.17)
Then
∆pα =
√ ħω
2 [4 Im {α} + 1 − 4 Im {α}]1/2 = ħω
2 , ∆qα = ħ
2ω . (4.18)
The uncertainty relation for the coherent states will have a simple form of
∆pα∆qα = ħ
2 ∼/ α. (4.19)
One can see that the uncertainty ∆pα∆qα does not depend on α, and it is equal to the vacuum state uncertainty, which is minimal among all the possible Fock states. So the coherent states minimize the uncertainty of the quantum fluctuations. The phase space representation of the coherent state is shown in Fig. 10 (b) along with the vacuum state. From this illustrative picture one can expect that the coherent state can be generated from a vacuum state with a linear operator Dˆ (α) which makes some sort of a state shifting in the phase space:
|α〉 = Dˆ (α) |0〉 , (4.20)
Indeed, the operator Dˆ exists and is called the displacement operator. In order to construct it, one can make trivial operations:
e−|α|2/2
∞
∑
n=0
αn
√n! |n〉 = Dˆ (α) |0〉 , (4.21)
and since |n〉 = (aˆ†)n
√n! |0〉, so
D(α) = e−|α|2/2eαaˆ† e−α∗aˆ. (4.22)
Remark: factor e−α∗aˆ does not change the result (because e−α∗aˆ |0〉 = |0〉), but gives some additional properties to the Dˆ (α):
1. Using the Hausdorff relation we can get a compact form of the displacement operator: Dˆ (α) = eαaˆ†−α∗aˆ. (4.23)
2. The displacement operator is a unitary operator. It means that Dˆ (α)Dˆ †(α) = Dˆ †(α)Dˆ (α) = ˆ1.
3. Since Dˆ †(α) = Dˆ (−α), the hermitian conjugate of the displacement operator can also be interpreted as a displacement in the opposite “direction”.
4. Following relations hold:
Dˆ †(α)ˆaDˆ (α) = aˆ + α, (4.24)
Dˆ (α)ˆaDˆ †(α) = aˆ − α, (4.25)
Dˆ (α)Dˆ (β) = e(αβ∗−α∗β)/2Dˆ (α + β). (4.26)

4.5 Squeezed states or getting the maximum accuracy!
The discussed fluctuations behaviour of the Fock and coherent states do not have only abstract fundamental value, but there are very practical consequence. The quantum fluctuations limit the accuracy of the optical measurements: even if you manage to suppress all the sources of systematic error in optical measurement the quantum noise will still be present. Thus, one of the natural question, which may appear: is it possible to overcome the limit of ∆pα∆qα = ħ
2 to get more accurate measurements?
Sure, we cannot break the uncertainty principle but we can title the balance of scales for ours good. The main idea is to squeeze light state in the geometrical meaning making an oval from the circle in the phase space(see Fig. 11). This will give us suppression of the uncertainty at least in one of the directions.

To get quantitative and more specific description one can use the squeeze operator :
Sˆ (ξ) |α〉 = |α, ξ〉 , (4.27)
where |ξ| — ratio of the main semiaxes of squeezed state, arg ξ — a turning angle. Here are some helpful properties of the squeeze operator:
1. It make be written as following:
Sˆ = eξaˆ†2−ξ∗aˆ2 . (4.28)
2. It is commutative with displacement operator:
Sˆ(ξ)Dˆ (α) 6= Dˆ (α)Sˆ(ξ). (4.29)
Another a more explicit view on that can be given with help of a simple consideration. The average value of a single mode field is as follows:
E = ε|α| cos [ωt + φ+] . (4.30)
Now, assume that we have fluctuations artificially added to this expression, resulting in: E(t) = ε (|α| + δα) cos [ωt + φ + δφ] , (4.31)
where δα and δφ are the fluctuating components of the amplitude and phase. Withtin this picture the Fock and coherent states can be visualized in according to Fig. 12 (a).

One can see that coherent state has constant level of fluctuations. Now, if one suppresses the fluctuations of either amplitude or phase the signal will be modified according to Fig. 12 (b) and (c). Measuring them at exact points, one can break the quantum noise limits and measure the signal well below the threshold provided by the Heisenberg principal. Lets draw attention to (4.28). We can notice that squeeze operator Sˆ consist of squares of ladder operators (∼ aˆ†2, aˆ2). It means here we have a generation of second harmonic (2ħω instead of ħω). In other words, from a experimenter’s point of view, to get the squeezed state one needs a non-linear optical element with χ2 6= 0, so it’s polarizability P = χ1E + χ2E2.

5 The coherence of light
The coherence of electromagnetic field is one of the most important characheristic of the light and photon state. It also gives the information about the state of the quantum sources, which emitted the light. Almost all the methods of testing the coherence of light are based on interferometry effects. Thus, we start to consider the coherence of light on the classical examples of light interference.
5.1 Michelson stellar interferometer
One of the important ones is Michelson stellar interferometer invented by the Albert Abraham Michelson in 19th century (see Fig. 13). The basic idea of this interferometer was studying the double stars and the angular distance between them just basing on their optical or microwaveve signals.
Figure 13: A Michelson stellar interferometer
Lets consider Michelson stellar interferometer (fig 13). From distant stars the two light beams is coming to our set-up. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so we can write:
E = Ek
(eikrM1 + eikrM2
) + Ek′
(
eik′rM1 + eik′rM2
)
. (5.1)
If we decide to compute the intensity, we will get (see Scully)
I = 〈E · E∗〉t = 4I0

  
1 + cos

2
]
} {{ }
fast term


  
, (5.2)
where r0 = rM1 − rM2, I0 = 〈Ek · E∗
k〉t = 〈Ek′ · E∗
k′〉t. To make out light and dark spots we need the following condition
kr0φ ≈ π → φ = π
kr0
. (5.3)
It means that to change light spot to the dark one we need ∆r0 = π
kφ . So the bigger
distance between mirrors M1 and M2, the better resolution we get (we will be able to detect smaller φ). But there appear to be a lot of technical troubles.
37


Figure 14: A symmetric interferometer with distant photodetectors
One can chose another pill and built a set up with two distant photodetectors (fig 14). Now we don’t have annoying mirrors and measure only currents i1 and i2, which are proportional to the intensities I1 and I2 of incident light beams. By this framework we can significantly increase r0 and this will lead to a higher resolution. People who did very precise measurements, noticed that they no longer measure intensities of indecent light, but only noises of almost single photons. Now lets take a look at this situation from a theoretical point of view. Let us compute the following correlator
g(2) = 〈i1, i2〉
〈i1〉〈i2〉 , (5.4)
where
i1 = 〈i1〉 + ∆i1, i2 = 〈i2〉 + ∆i2, 〈i1〉 = 〈i2〉 = i0. (5.5)
Then we can write
g(2) = i2
0 + 〈∆i1, ∆i2〉
i2
0
= 1 + 〈∆i1, ∆i2〉
i2
0
. (5.6)
So in fact one measured the average of ∆i1 and ∆i2. To study the issue in more details the so called HBT experiment was done. The principle scheme of the set up it shown on fig 15. The heart of the matter is that method allows to avoid the atmospherically
sensitive terms (fast terms) like cos
[ (k+k′)·r0 2
]
.
Lets analyze the second order correlator:
g(2)(τ ) = 1 + 〈∆i(t)∆i(t + τ )〉
i2
0
. (5.7)
Here can single out some properties:
1. g(2)(0) = 1 + 〈∆i2(t)〉
i2
0 ≥ 1.
2. τli→m∞ g(2)(τ ) = 1.
3. g(2)(0) ≥ g(2)(τ ).

To summarize we could guess that approximate plot of g(2)(τ ) is as it shown of fig. 16 with a solid line. During measuring noises, which were mentioned thereinbefore, experimentalists got the next weird result: g(2)(τ ) < 1. (5.8)
This effect is called photon bunching. But a few lines above it was shown that g(2)(τ ) ≥ 1. How could it be possible? Let us consider the same experiments but with a single photons emitter (fig. 15 b). Assume τ = 0, so then we calculate how photon at place 1 is correlated with a photon at place 1′. If our light source emits discreate photos then single photon cannot be at two places at the same time, so g(2)(0) = 0.

5.2 Quantum theory of photodetection
Photons are described by field operators
Eˆ = ˆE+ + Eˆ −, (5.9)
where
ˆE+ =

a) b)
Figure 17: a) An indecent photon generate an electron which brings current; b) Atom states
To simplify all the calculations let us consider only one mode and only one linear polarisation of field:
Eˆ + = Eˆ+ek. (5.12)
When an indecent photon got absorbed, it excites the atom detector: |i〉 → |f 〉 (see fig. 17, b). The probability of absorption of one photon (= the probability of detection of one photon) depends only on operator Eˆ+ due to detection principle (see fig. 17). The transition probability of the detector atom for absorbing a photon from the field at position r between times t and t + dt is proportional to ω1(r, t)dt, with
ω1(r, t) =
∑
f
∣ ∣
∣〈f | Eˆ+ |i〉
∣ ∣ ∣
2
=
∑
f
〈i| Eˆ− |f 〉 〈f | Eˆ+ |i〉 = 〈i| Eˆ−(r, t)Eˆ+(r, t) |i〉 . (5.13)
Here the ∑
f |f 〉 〈f | = 1 relation was used. Shall us define the first-order correlation function
g(1)(r1, t1; r2, t2) ∼ 〈i| Eˆ−(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r2, t2) |i〉 = 〈Eˆ−(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r2, t2)〉. (5.14)
It is useful for quantifying the coherence between two electric fields, as measured in a Michelson or other linear optical interferometer. Here we used the average notation as
〈Aˆ〉 d=ef 〈i| Aˆ |i〉 . (5.15)
The detection probability of two photons is given by
ω2(r1, t1; r2, t2) =
∑
f
∣ ∣
∣〈f | Eˆ+(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r2, t2) |i〉
∣ ∣ ∣

=
= 〈i| Eˆ−(r2, t2)Eˆ−(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r2, t2) |i〉 . (5.16)
40


The joint probability of photodetection is thus governed by the second-order correlation function:
g(2)(r1, t1; r2, t2) = 〈Eˆ−(r2, t2)Eˆ−(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r2, t2)〉
〈Eˆ−(r2, t2)Eˆ+(r2, t2)〉〈Eˆ−(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r1, t1)〉 . (5.17)
It refers to intensity (e.g. for currents). The exact expression for the first-order correlation function is the following:
g(1)(r1, t1; r2, t2) = 〈Eˆ−(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r2, t2)〉
√
〈Eˆ−(r2, t2)Eˆ+(r2, t2)〉〈Eˆ−(r1, t1)Eˆ+(r1, t1)〉
. (5.18)
In fact it refers to interference in quantum mechanic. A particular case is often used, precisely a case r1 = r2 and τ = t2 − t1. In such case notation is g(2)(r1, t1; r2, t2) d=ef g(2)(τ ). So we have
g(2)(τ ) = 〈Eˆ−(τ )Eˆ−(0)Eˆ+(0)Eˆ+(τ )〉
〈Eˆ−(0)Eˆ+(0)〉2 , (5.19)
where 〈Eˆ−(0)Eˆ+(0)〉 = 〈Eˆ−(τ )Eˆ+(τ )〉, ∀τ was used which means that the signal is homogeneous. For a case of only one mode field we can write
g(2)(τ ) = 〈aˆ†(τ )ˆa†(0)ˆa(0)ˆa(τ )〉
〈aˆ†aˆ〉2 . (5.20)
Important to notice that in numerator of fraction is normally ordered.
Example: The second-order correlation function for Fock states (|i〉 = |n〉).
g(2)(0) = 〈n| aˆ†aˆ†aˆaˆ |n〉
〈n| aˆ†aˆ |n〉 = n(n − 1)
n2 = 1 − 1
n < 1, ∀n. (5.21)
This is a factor of a single-photon beam, e.g. n = 1 → g(2)(0) = 0. Exactly this effect was observed in a HBT experiment!
Homework. The second-order correlation function for coherent states. Compute g(2)(0) for case |i〉 = |α〉.

After that we make a transition to the new Hamiltonian by this energy shift

It is convenient to make new denotions:

where

σˆ+ |b〉 = |a〉 〈b|b〉 = |a〉 , (6.19)
σˆ− |a〉 = |b〉 〈a|a〉 = |b〉 . (6.20)

iħC ̇ b,n+1(t) = ħg√n + 1Ca,n(t)e−i∆t. (6.40)
For simplicity let us consider a resonant excitation, it means we need to put ∆ = 0 in (6.40). After we have

If we put n = 0 we get ΩR0 = g 6= 0. We have a vacuum interaction: no field, interaction exists!

Figure 21: Time evolution of the population inversion W (t) for an initially coherent state.
Homework. Deadline: 29th of December
1. (6 pts) (See problem 6.2 from Scully). One of the common models of light-atom interaction in a cavity can be described by the Hamiltonian :
H = ħω0σz + ħωa+a + ħg(√a+aa+σ− + σ+a√a+a),
where interaction depends on the intensity. Compute the inverse population at the timescale of Rabi oscillations, considering initial state of photons as coherent.
6.2 Collapse and revival
Another important quantity is the inversion W (t) which is related to the probabilty amplitudes Ca,n(t) and Cb,n(t) by the expression
W (t) =
∑
n
(|Ca,n(t)|2 − |Cb,n(t)|2) . (6.43)
In fig. 21 W (t) is plotted as a function of normalized time gt for an initial coherent state. The behavior of W (t) is quite different from the corresponding curve (fig. 2) in the semiclassical theory. In the present case the envelope of the sinusoidal Rabi oscillations ’collapses’ to zero. However as time increases we encounter a ’revival ’ of the collapsed inversion. This behavior of collapse and revival of inversion is repeated with increasing time, with the amplitude of Rabi osculations decreasing and the time duration in which revival takes place increasing and ultimately overlapping with the earlier revival.
6.3 Energy spectrum. Dispersion relation
Let us find eigenstates of Hˆ which is given by (6.30). Here, for convenience, the vacuum field energy is set to 0, so

The equation for eigenvalues is

Next terms will appear:
Hˆ0 |a〉 |n〉 =

|a〉 |n〉 , (6.46)
Hˆ0 |b〉 |n + 1〉 =

|b〉 |n + 1〉 , (6.47)
Hˆint |a〉 |n〉 = ħg√n + 1 |b〉 |n + 1〉 , (6.48)
Hˆint |b〉 |n + 1〉 = ħg√n + 1 |a〉 |n〉 . (6.49)
Important to notice that number of quantas is concerned, if we take basis |a〉 |n〉 and
|b〉 |n + 1〉. After acting Hˆint we stay in the same subspace with the same basis. Consequently, eigenfunctions may be written as
|ψ〉 = |φ1〉 · |φ2〉 · ... · |φn〉 · ... (6.50)
Each of |φn〉 acts on its own subspace and does not affect the others:
|φn〉 = cn |a〉 |n〉 + c2n |b〉 |n + 1〉 . (6.51)
It leads to a very imports consequence — Hˆ is block-diagonal matrix :
Hˆ =

      
Hˆ1 0 0 . . . 0 . . .
0 Hˆ2 0 . . . 0 . . .

Where each of Hˆn is a 2 × 2 matrix. Looking for an energy spectrum (6.45) is equivalent to the Hamiltonian diagonalization. We simplified our problem and now we need only to diagonalize 2 × 2 matrices or in other words we need to solve
Hˆn |φn〉 = En |φn〉 . (6.53)

7 Spontaneous relaxation. Weisskopf-Wigner theory
We have shown that quantum approach to atom-field interaction results in Rabi oscillation between the excited atomic state and photon states. In particular, the interaction with field vacuum results in vacuum Rabi oscillations and solves the problem of atomic state evolution in the absence of the excitation field. However, the the origin of spontaneous emission of excited stated has not been discussed yet. At the same time, we have seen that effects similar to exponential decay of the excited state appears in collapserevival dynamics, when an atom interacts with many photon states of a single mode field. In this lecture, we will see that spontaneous emission originates from interaction with multimode field.

∑
n,k
(ca,nk(t) |a〉 |nk〉 + cb,nk(t) |b〉 |nk〉) , (7.2)
where ca(b),nk
d=ef ca(b),nk1,nk2,... and |nk〉 d=ef |nk1〉 |nk2〉 · . . . . We assume that at time t = 0
the atom is in the excited state |a〉 and the field modes are in the vacuum state |0〉. That means that one needs to consider only state with total number of quanta equal to one. That reduces the wavefunction to the following form:
|ψ(t)〉 = ca,0(t) |a〉 |0〉 +

8 Dipole radiation. Dyadic Green’s function. The
Purcell effect: classical approach
8.1 Dipole radiation and dyadic Green’s function
NB: Brief overview of Green’s functions
A Green’s function, G(x, s), of a linear differential operator Lˆ acting on distributions over a subset of the Euclidean space, at a point s, is any solution of
LˆG(x, s) = δ(x − s). (8.1)
The knowledge of G(x, s) allows one to write the solution of the differential equation with with arbitrary inhomogeneous function in rhs. In other words,
Lˆu(x) = f (x) → u(x) =
∫
dsG(x, s)f (s). (8.2)
Consider an oscillating point dipole d(t) = d0e−iωt which is located in the point r0. Let us find the electric field generated by this dipole in a free space. In order to solve the Maxwell equation we the express the dipole source in terms of current density a time derivative of polarization density:
j = ∂P
∂t = ∂d(t)
∂t δ(r − r0) = −iωd(t)δ(r − r0) (8.3)
We then can write down the Maxwell equations with account for the currents sources (in SI units)


rot E = −∂B
∂t , (8.4a)
rot H = ∂D
∂t + j, (8.4b)
div D = ρ, (8.4c)
div B = 0. (8.4d)
After applying the Fourier transform over time (in fact just ∂t → −iω) and using D = εε0E and B = μμ0H we obtain
rot rot E − μμ0εε0ω2E = iμμ0ωj (8.5)
introducing k = ω
c
√εμ we get
rot rot E − k2E = k2
εε0
d0δ(r − r0). (8.6)
Here we have an inhomogeneous differential equation with a δ–function on the r.h.s. of the equation. It solution manifests itself in a Green’s function ˆG(r, r0), however as Eq. (8.6) is a vectorial equation then the Green’s function for electromagnetic field is a tensor of second rank or a so–called dyadic Green’s function. This fact is represent by writing a ”hat” over G. By having the Green’s function (the radiation of a arbitrary oriented dipole), we can calculate radiation for any complex current j(r).

8.1.1 Derivation of the Green’s function for Maxwell equations
We construct now the explicit form of ˆG in a homogeneous medium. The general definition of the dyadic Green’s function is defined as a solution of the equation
rot rot ˆG(r, r0) − k2 ˆG(r, r0) = Iˆδ(r − r0). (8.8)
All we need to find is the relation which connects electric field E(r, ω) and current density j(r, ω). In order to find it, one can write down the expression of electric field in terms of scalar and vectorial potentials
E = −∂A
∂t − ∇φ. (8.9)
If we use electromagnetic potential A then we can choose any gauge for our convenience. Let us take the Lorenz gauge
div A + εμ
c2
∂φ
∂t = 0 → ∇φ = c2
iωεμ∇ div A. (8.10)
By using the gauge formula and relation for vector potential B = rot A, one gets the equation for φ and A:



∆A + k2A = −μμ0j, (8.11a)
∆φ + k2φ = − ρ
εε0
. (8.11b)
As we can see (8.11) —inhomogeneous Helmholtz equations. The Green’s function is well-known from classical electrodynamics course:
G0(r, r0) = eikR
4πR , R = |r − r0| . (8.12)
It means that we can write the solution of (8.11) as


where Iˆik = δik — a unit tensor. To get the final answer for ˆG we substitute (8.13), (8.10) in (8.9) and compare the result with (8.7). Substitution gives
E(r) = iωA − c2

Example: Field of a point dipole in vacuum
Let us assume a monochromic dipole, so from (8.3) we obtain

Remark: it is worth noting that if d0 = (d0, 0, 0) then the first column of ˆG corresponds to the field, induced by a dipole directed along the x-axis.
8.1.2 Near-, intermediate- and far-field parts of Green’s function
Sometimes it is convenient to write (8.15) in different form:
ˆG(r, r0) R=r−r0

Iˆ + 3 − 3ikR − k2R2

. (8.19)
Though this expression looks bulky, it can be separated into several components, which have different distance dependence (containing different powers of kR)
ˆG(R) = Gˆ NF + ˆGIF + ˆGF F , (8.20)
where
(near field = electrostatic) ˆGNF = eikR

If a dipole is dieing down then its energy
W (t) = W (0)e−γt (8.45)
and radiation power
P (t) = d

At time t ≈ 0 we obtain Pmedium(t)
Pvacuum(t) ≈ γ

We have the same result but only using the classical approach. But one needs to remember that the reason of radiation has a quantum nature.

Which is correct in contrast to (9.18). To define the spectrum we need to use the Wiener–Khintchine theorem. In short, this theorem allows to find spectrum using the knowledge of the correlation function (fig. 34) using relation

10 Atom in a damped cavity
In the previous sections we have discussed different parts of the system (fig. 36) which we are going to combine in this section.
Figure 36: From left to right: atom in vacuum, atom in the cavity, field in a cavity in a thermostat.
Here we are going to study the evolution of a single two-level atom initially prepared in the upper level |a〉 of the transition resonant with the cavity mode (fig 37). In particular, it is seen that the spontaneous emission rate of the atom inside a resonant cavity is substantially enhanced over its free-space value (Purcell effect).
Figure 37: Atom in a cavity with losses. System has two coupling constants: g — atom and field coupling, Γ — cavity and reservoir coupling (transparency of a mirror)
10.1 The Purcell factor for a closed cavity
The decay rate γ can be written as
γ = 2π |g(ω)|2 D(ω)
V , (10.1)
where D/V = ρ is the density of state. In vacuum it is D0(ω) = ω2

There two cases which is interesting to consider:

10.2 Rigorous derivation of the atomic decay
If the approach is rigorous then we have to call Mr. Hamiltonian immediately
Hˆ = HˆA + HˆF + HˆAF + HˆR + HˆRF, (10.8)
where A stands for atom, F for field and R for reservoir. Summands of Hˆ are the following
HˆF = ħωˆn, HˆA = 1

where we have got the same unknown averaging. To obtain last result the commutation relations for σ–matrices had been used:
[σˆz, σˆ−] = −2σˆ−, [σˆz, σˆ+] = 2σˆ+. (10.17)
To solve (10.15) and (10.16) we need to know the time dependence of that unknown Hermitean operator 〈aˆ†σˆ− − σˆ+aˆ〉, which equation of motion involves the quantity 〈aˆ†σˆzaˆ〉 and so on. In general, we get an infinite set of equations which may not be analytically solvable. The way out is the following — we need to cut the chain of equations at some step. Here the things we are going to suppose:
1. Put cavity at zero temperature reservoir ( ̄ˆnR = 0).
2. Initially the atom is in the excited sate |a〉 and field inside the cavity is in the vacuum state |0〉.
In other words, we consider a single photon approximation. If the photon is only one then all summands which are proportional to aˆ2 or ˆa†2 are identically zero. As the result, under these conditions, we obtain the following system of equations:

Using the single photon approximation is always simplifies the problem and make it look more ”classical”. This system has two main parameters: g and Γ (see fig. 37). Let us consider two limiting behavior regimes:
Regime 1. Γ g → Γ ΩR or a overdamping regime. Here we have
〈σˆz〉 = −1 + 2e−4g2 t
Γ = −1 + 2e−γt, (10.20)

Pa = 〈σˆz〉 + 1 = e− Γ

11 Casimir force and his close friends
This section is an overview of so-called fluctuation-induced forces. All effects here have a stochastic nature. Depending on the point of view this force may have different names: Casimir force, van der Waals force and Casimir–Polder force.
Example: A Frenchman of keen observation
In the XVIII century French navy men noticed one interesting thing. Two ships in a confused sea and with no-wind conditions being at a distance of 40 meters began to attract each other (Fig. 40). That happens because of the wave interference in the space between them. The calm see between ships creates less pressure than the confused one outside. Because of the same reason plastic islands originate.
Figure 40: Two ships in a confused sea.
Fluctuating charges in a neutral body give rise to fluctuating electromagnetic fields which interact with the charges in other bodies. As a consequence, electromagnetic fields mediate between the charge fluctuations in separate bodies. The resulting charge correlations give rise to an electromagnetic force that is referred to as the dispersion force.
Example: A skillful Gecko
Geckos climb even the most slippery surfaces with ease and hang from glass using a single toe (Fig. 41). The secret behind this extraordinary climbing skill lies with millions of tiny keratin hairs on the surface of each foot. Although the dispersion force associated with each hair is miniscule, the millions of hairs collectively produce a powerful adhesive effect. The “gecko effect” is applied to the design of strongly adhesive tapes.

11.1 Casimir force between two perfectly conducting plates
Let us consider two parallel perfectly conducting metal plates in vacuum at the distance d. We choose z axis orthogonally to the plates (Fig. 42). Due to the boundary conditions waves have nods where plates are. So wave vector kz is quantized as
kz = nπ
d , n ∈ Z. (11.1)
Figure 42: Perfectly conducting plates in vacuum. Wave vector kz is quantized.
The main idea of calculating the force is the following. We expect that the force between two plates at the distance d is potential, so we could write
Fz(d) = − dU
dz
∣ ∣ ∣
∣z=d
. (11.2)
It means that we need to find the potential energy of the plate interaction U (d), which shows how much energy we need to expend to separate two plates from distance z = d to z → ∞, so
U (d) = E(d) − E(d → ∞). (11.3)
We need to remind that in the picture of secondary quantization Mr. Hamiltonian of photons looks as (??)

where ωk = c|k|. Our system has no real photons, so energy of the ground state |0〉 is
E = 〈0| Hˆ |0〉 . (11.5)
Further calculations depends on how many dimensions we live.

But we are physicist and we do need right answers other than a dense jungle of mathematical proof. The main feat to calculate (11.10) is to introduce new parameter s and find Es pretending that Re s > 3 and our life is fine and full of convergent integrals and sums. After that we just brassily say E = lsi→m0 Es. Let us start

11.2 Casimir–Polder force
In this part we are going to find fluctuation-induced force using point electric dipole approximation and Green’s function (GF) formalism. Due to the fact that magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interaction is usually the next order effect, point electric dipole approximation is enough for many cases. Let us consider in average neutral objects with independent fluctuating field Efl and dipole moment pfl. Now, we need to keep in mind that fluctuating filed induces a dipole moment of the object with polarizability α may be written as
pin(ω) = α(ω)Efl. (11.21)
Moreover, any fluctuating dipole emits electromagnetic field. Induced field may be easily written using Green’s function approach
Ein(r, ω) = ω2

ˆG(r, r0, ω)pfl(ω), (11.22)
where r0 is the location of the fluctuating dipole.
Figure 43: A small particle near unknown media, which is given by its Green’s function.
From the electrodynamics an average electromagnetic force acting on a point dipole is given by
〈F〉 = 〈 ∑
i=x,y,z
pi∇Ei〉. (11.23)
Both p and E may be induced or fluctuative, so F ∼ pE = (pfl + pin)(Efl + Ein). Because of the fact that fluctuations are independent 〈pflEfl〉 = 0 and due to (11.21) and (11.22) 〈pinEin〉 ∼ 〈Eflpfl〉 = 0. Other term are proportional to the mean square of fluctuating values which are non–zero. Then (11.23) transforms into
〈F〉 =
∑
i
[〈pin
i ∇Efl
i 〉 + 〈pfl
i ∇Ein
i 〉] . (11.24)
Applying Fourier transform in respect that E∗ = E and with the help of (11.21) and (11.22) we obtain

Expressions for correlators may be obtained with the help of fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). Dipole radiation is associated with the imaginary part of the polarizability1. In liberal interpretation the FDT connects the fluctuating radioactive noise of the system with its losses. Without any additional details (see Novotny L.Principles of nano–optics, chapter 14):

78


Now let us consider the simplest case: two point dipole with polarizabilities α1 and α2. In other words, we replaced the unknown media in Fig. 43 by a another small particle. Total electric filed at some point r may be written as
E(r) = k2
ε0
ˆG0(r, r1)p1 + k2
ε0
ˆG0(r, r2)p2, (11.30)
where Gˆ 0 is the vacuum GF and k2 = ω2/c2. Now we want something that looks like (11.29). So we need to rewrite p2 in terms of p1. The dipole moment of the second particle is induced by the field from the first particle E1(r2)
p2 = α2E1(r2) = α2

(11.34) This is the Casimir–Polder potential. It is important to look at asymptotics:
• R → 0:
U (R → 0) ∼ 1

This is the van der Waals potential.
• R → ∞:
U (R → ∞) ∼ 1

This is the Casimir potential.
11.3 Orders of forces
Two small metal plates with side area A = 1 μm and at the distance d = 5 nm in accordance to (11.15) attracts to each other with force F ∼ 0.1 mN, which is incredibly strong for a nanoworld. If we take in account the finite size of the plates, non–ideal conductivity and medium around then we get F ∼ 1 nN, which is still enough to crush a biomolecule! By the way, it is possible to measure forces up to several pN.

11.4 The latest advances
11.4.1 The dynamical Casimir effect
The dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated moving mirror. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made by researchers at the Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. Virtual photons between plates are seeds of real photons. The kinetic energy of moving mirrors transforms into radiative energy. This effect is possible only at very high frequencies, ideally plates should oscillate with an optical frequency. This can be obtained by modulating effective ε in the media between mirrors, so the optic length between them is also changing. Moreover, due to the conservation laws, new photons are entangled.
11.4.2 Quantum levitation or repulsive Casimir–Lifshitz forces
Let us consider a nanoparticle over a surface. With respect to some conditions attractive force may become repulsive. In such case this effect is called the generalized Casimir effect or Casimir–Lifshitz effect. See Fig. 47 for more details. This may used as a building block for ultra slippery surfaces in the future.
