The Bridges of Königsberg
+ Königsberg (Kaliningrad), the capital of Eastern Prussia, supported the trade by its fleet of ships by building seven bridges across the river Pregel that surrounded the town.
+ The question is can one walk across all seven bridges and never cross the same one twice?
+ The problem remained unsolved until 1735, when Leonard Euler, a Swiss born mathematician: Euler’s proof was the first time someone solved a mathematical problem using a graph.

Graph-structured data is everywhere
+ Graph-structured data at the heart of complex systems, play a major role in our daily life, in science and economy X Cooperation between billions of individuals, or communication infrastructures - billions of cell phones with computers and satellites -, interactions between thousands of genes and metabolites within our cells, billions of neurons in our brain, internet of things . . .
+ Understanding mathematical foundations, description, prediction, and eventually control this kind of systems is one of the major scientific challenges of the 21st century. X The Bridges of Königsberg (18th century with Euler), Paul Erdös and Alfréd Rényi (1959), Mark Granovetter (1973) X Emergence of Network Science X Also the most revolutionary technologies, empowering everything from Google to Facebook, CISCO, Twitter, LinkedIn, . . . X And neural networks . . .
