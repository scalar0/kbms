Preface
The Handbook of Engineering Systems Design provides the first authoritative survey of the state of the art of the engineering systems design perspective, written by leading experts. The Handbook will be a resource for engineering systems design scholars and enable industry practitioners, policymakers and researchers in other fields to discover, apply and further develop the thinking, methods and results. And it is time for learning about and applying the engineering systems perspective: The world is facing a series of challenges which require global effort to overhaul existing technical infrastructures in close synchrony with social transformations in our societies and reforms in institutional governance. In engineering systems design, technology is seen within a wider socio-technical systems perspective, approaching our world as made up of global engineering systems such as the energy system, the transport system and the healthcare system, which are moreover connected by multiple technical, social and institutional links all over the world. This Handbook provides you with the means to shape these global engineering systems by designing interventions and thus provides a basis for addressing the global challenges. The Handbook is the result of a joint editorial effort by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), bringing together expert knowledge of the field of engineering systems design within the wider academic and practitioner landscape across the globe. With all scholars who contributed to giving the state of the art in the field, this Handbook unlocks for you the richness and importance of engineering systems design.

Abstract
Framing and understanding our connected and evolving world requires a systems perspective. Intervening and acting towards more sustainable futures and a humane society requires (re-)designing. To achieve that, the Handbook of Engineering Systems Design focuses on socio-technical engineering systems shaping our modern lives. Such systems are fulfilling core functions in society and are characterised by a high degree of technical and organisational complexity, multifacetedness of human behaviour, elaborated processes, and long lifecycles. Examples include generating and distributing energy, enabling global communication networks, creating affordable healthcare, managing global digital manufacturing and supply chains, or building and maintaining critical infrastructure. The Handbook is an authoritative compendium and reference source written by leading experts in the field from across the globe. It is written for scholars as well as practitioners transforming society through research, education, industry, and policy and as such, an essential resource for decision makers to understand their role as change makers. In this introduction, the core terms of the engineering systems approach are defined and the current context in which engineers work is described, characterised by the developments of globalisation and interconnectedness and by the challenges of sustainability and digitalisation. The introduction then focuses on interventions in engineering systems by design, looks at advantages and some concerns of adopting the engineering systems approach, poses open questions for the future, including a call to action for training the ability to connect – connectability – and provides a summary of the contents of the contributions to the five parts of the Handbook.

Introduction: Creating a Humane Society
Society seems to be stuck with effectively addressing, moving on, and resolving the major problems of our times. Production and consumption are too high for being maintained by the Earth and efforts to adapt to sustainable levels need proper appreciation of the interconnected nature of our world. All is interconnected – in nature, in engineering, in societies – and any effort to change one part to improve society is therefore typically affected by and affecting multiple feedback- and feedforward loops, including potential rebound effects in other parts of the world. The proposition advanced in this Handbook of Engineering Systems Design is that
4 A. Maier et al.


engineering is creating the means to navigate and cut through this impasse and to achieve societal transitions. Engineering researchers and practitioners have developed an engineering systems perspective on our world by which changes can be realised through design interventions in these engineering systems. In this Handbook we have collected the state of the art about this novel and urgently needed design approach to interventions in sociotechnical engineering systems, and can now share it with engineers, researchers and policy makers to improve our societies. Our current world is one that is to a large extent shaped and maintained by engineers (Subrahmanian et al. 2018) with the aim of creating a humane society (Simon 1981: 162). Our food, our clothes, our buildings, our transport and communication devices, and much more, are made available and maintained by applications of technologies developed by engineers. As a species we have been prospering with these engineering efforts, as our welfare, our life-expectancy and the number of people living on Earth have continuously risen in the last centuries. These rises have in turn led to new problems, which are currently deepening with climate change and the depletion of resources. We find ourselves in a dilemma. On the one hand, the world appears to be stuck when we try to improve it. Production is complex, consumption habitually entrenched, and demand and disparity are high. On the other hand, we need to move fast and in informed directions. Our annual demand has for some time already exceeded what the Earth can renew in a year. This ecological overshoot had in 2008 reached a 50% deficit, meaning that it takes the Earth 1.5 years to generate the renewable resources that people use and absorb the CO2 waste they produce, in 1 year. And some resources will be depleted for good. The consequences of excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are clearly noticeable. Climate change and ocean acidification places additional stress on biodiversity and ecosystems, which in turn has direct impact on depletion of life space. These and other major societal challenges of our time – climate change, food security, financial security, health inequities – cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems and opportunities, meaning that they are all interconnected and interdependent. And from a systemic point of view, a sustainable society needs to be designed in such a way that our ways of consuming and producing, physical infrastructures, and technologies are in accordance with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life (Capra and Luisi 2012). And if it was not clear before, latest now has the COVID-19 pandemic shown us vividly and morbidly how crucial it is to take a systems perspective and to design in agreement among nations if we are to solve such worldwide problems. There could not be a more important moment in our life paths. Engineers have been expected to contribute to dealing with these challenges with new technological applications and innovations. Ever since the industrial revolution, concepts of growth and the trajectory of accelerated growth have become the ruling idea of this age, with technology playing a central role. With promises and hopes set on technology, we also observe that it is increasingly difficult for engineers to offer improvements. The twenty-first century brings an increased recognition that engineers have a harder time to live up the expectations to contribute to resolving our current challenges. The technological fabric that has been put in place is to a large

extent causing climate change and the depletion of resources. This fabric is moreover resisting interventions to swiftly transform it to one that is more sustainable. Our world seems locked in its current technological fabric and in the problems it creates, and engineers lack efficient means to break this (dead)lock. What is expected of an engineer is much more than ever, some refer to a new breed of engineers or perhaps engineers in new roles, where engineers are required to be technically savvy, socially savvy, ethically savvy, business savvy, finance savvy, laws and regulations savvy, and more (Douglas et al. 2010). Our proposition is that engineering is creating the means to live up to these expectations. Engineering researchers and practitioners have developed an engineering systems perspective on our world by which change can be realised through design interventions in these engineering systems. This continues our proud tradition of increasing our engineering capabilities: From devising artefacts that require the expertise of multiple experts, such as the first cars, to complex systems being built from multiple interconnected components, such as our transportation and supply chain system, to, finally, engineering systems that represent the socio-technological infrastructure our society rests on, for example advanced renewable energy grids. As expressed by some of our colleagues: “Today, in the epoch of engineering systems, we can see an increasing recognition among engineers that beyond the need for more complex and sophisticated technical analysis, even more is required to solve real problems.” (De Weck et al. 2011: 27/28) This Handbook collects state of the art knowledge and practices about analysing the current sociotechnical fabric of our world and about design interventions that can transform that fabric. The central perspective in this body of knowledge is to understand the technological fabric in terms of sociotechnical engineering systems. Engineering systems are “systems characterized by a high degree of technical complexity, social intricacy, and elaborated processes, aimed at fulfilling important functions in society” (De Weck et al. 2011: 31). The Handbook of Engineering Systems Design has contributions that employ this engineering systems perspective for collecting ways to designing effective interventions in the fabric. Seen in that way, the boundary between physical structures and the design of social systems dissolves almost completely (Simon 1981: 175). To create a humane society, sociotechnical means focus on (1) humans and technology, (2) social contexts with social, political, and economic considerations emphasising societal values, (3) understanding socio-political- and regulatory contexts, and (4) ethical education, including empathy for the environment. In this way the Handbook gives new means to engineers and policy makers to again meet the expectations to address the wicked problems our world is facing, ultimately to create whole systems change, to create societal transitions and transformations. Designing has been acknowledged as a bridge-builder between technology and humanity (Dorst 2019: 119), and rather than creating specific fixes focusing on addressing complex problem situations with a view toward system transformation. Designing in this Handbook is focusing on interventions, on re-designing, on giving impulses whilst being cognisant of the larger picture. We increasingly observe and read about the need for embedding systems thinking as early as possible in people’s lives, and we see a heightened awareness and emphasis of governments to speak
6 A. Maier et al.


about systems problems and to accredit engineers in particular as the ones who think in systems; all in all calling for taking a whole systems design approach to tackling wicked problems such as climate change and efforts towards net zero or net positive (National Engineering Policy Centre 2020). This is the time for systems thinkers and design doers. In this introduction to the Handbook of Engineering Systems Design we continue with introducing the core terms of the engineering systems approach. Then in section “The Current Context” we describe the current context in which engineers work, characterised by the developments of globalisation and connectedness, and by the challenges of sustainability and digitalisation. In section “Interventions in Engineering Systems: By Design” we focus on designing interventions in engineering systems. Section “Advantages, Concerns, and a Look to the Future of Engineering Systems Design” looks at advantages and some concerns of adopting the engineering systems approach, and poses open questions for the future. An overview of the contents of the different contributions to the Handbook is given in section “Content: The State of the Art of Engineering Systems Design in Five Parts.”
Core Terms
The proposition that meaningful change can be realised by designing interventions in engineering systems can be unpacked in two compatible ways. The first is that it means taking the world as consisting of interconnected engineering systems, such as (global) energy, infrastructure, and health systems, and arriving at change by designing interventions in these systems. The second way is to understand the proposition as advancing an engineering systems perspective in which the world is taken as consisting of technology, people, and processes. This means simultaneously considering designing and managing businesses, policy and technology. Both understandings have the underlying assumption of thinking in systems when designing, i.e. focusing attention on the relationships among the entities that make up the system and focusing on the knock-on effects when intervening (Meadows and Wright 2008). We find these throughout the Handbook. The core terms are described next.
Engineering Systems
Engineering systems are defined as complex sociotechnical systems that increasingly shape modern lives. It is our ambition to understand and improve the ways in which we can design and manage and policy navigate these systems. Engineering systems are complex sociotechnical systems that provide solutions to central economic and societal challenges, fulfil important functions in society and exist over long lifespans during which they continue to evolve. As such, “they are partially designed and partially evolved” (De Weck et al. 2011: 31). Such systems are characterised by core challenges, including technical and organisational complexity, multifacetedness of human behaviour, and uncertainty of long-life cycles. Examples include energy
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 7


generation and distribution, building and maintaining critical infrastructure, global manufacturing and supply chains, transportation of people and cargo, healthcare delivery, and global communication. By a strict understanding engineering systems are large scale global systems. Comprised of many constituent systems, products, and services, these systems continuously evolve. In the chapters in this Handbook, scoping to more “local” examples of such complex sociotechnical systems may be included, such as designing and operating solar energy systems or autonomous vehicles. To reconnect to the global nature of engineering systems, such examples are discussed from an engineering systems perspective, by analysing them as embedded in global systems of systems.
The Engineering Systems Perspective
The engineering systems perspective involves technology, processes, and policies, and is based on systems thinking. Taking an engineering systems perspective means focusing on connections. Eliciting and understanding connections, e.g., by using (re-)framing, mapping, modelling, analysis-, and synthesis methods and tools, enables bringing the anticipation of unintended consequences to the fore (Sillitto 2014) and as such enables emerging properties to be taken into consideration. For example, it can help to understand the consequences of bringing new and uncertain technologies into current system set-ups, to develop scenarios for envisaging how consumer behaviour can impact systems, and to identify how feedback loops can create dynamics. Taking an engineering systems perspective allows us to address complex challenges in holistic and structured ways. What this means in practice is that emphasis is placed on recognising connections, such as technical, social, or economic. It means further that we are actively asked to be aware of the boundaries that we draw, that we are actively asked to map which factors influence across boundaries, and the scope of the system (s) that we are going to take into consideration. Taking a systems perspective means to think of different influences and different drivers. It means to engage multiple disciplines – from the natural sciences, technology, engineering, social sciences, and humanities – to highlight connections between the domains and also to engage multiple stakeholders across science, business, government, and citizen groups. It means encouraging that multiple views are elicited and engaging people who know the detail while retaining the bigger picture. It means combining multiple fields of professional knowledge and integration of multiple stakeholders’ interests and expertise (technological, financial, regulatory, legal, ethical, workforce, and public-facing stakeholders). This does, however, not mean to take everything and everyone into account. Yet, it means to be cognisant of the connections and potential knock-on effects an intervention will create, also over time.
Engineering Systems Design Interventions
Designing in this Handbook is understood as “devising courses of action that change existing situations into desired situations” (Simon 1981: 129), and thereby
8 A. Maier et al.


as making change in societies (VanPatter 2021: 34/35). As such, the Handbook emphasises designing as change making, going beyond mere problem-solving to creating opportunities. Designing itself is moving from problem formulation or problem solving to reframing what we do as a task of system transformation (Dorst 2019: 117). Designing is central in humankinds’ relationship with the artificial world and the natural world. Designing is understood here to go beyond technologies, products, services, to being open to engaging with the large-scale challenges in an ever moving world (Jones 2014; Norman and Stappers 2015). Any intervention we are making, any initiative we are starting is in some shape or form designing. The complex situations this Handbook addresses require designing with a systems perspective. The onus is on all of us to be aware of designing interactions, of seeing connections, of seeing propagation impact pathways, of seeing potential implications. This will also mean that the paradigm of getting it right first time is impossible and in fact a barrier. The world is dynamic and evolving. Engineering systems designing as working through the impact of any kind of intervention in any kind of context means conceptualising, prototyping locally, thinking globally, modelling, simulating various scenarios and impact paths as ways forward. The chapters and structure of the Handbook bears the underlying emphasis of designing interventions. Why the focus on ‘interventions’ in engineering systems and interventions from an engineering systems perspective? One of the arguments in this book is that no one ever designs an entire engineering system (Züst and Troxler 2006: 12). Say, we do not tear down our energy and transportation system, to then rebuild an integrated smart grid with all-electric transportation. We only ever design an aspect of the system: in practically all cases, designing will consist of modifications or extensions to some existing element. Hence, we say engineering systems design is essentially designing these specific interventions as levers that move the overall system into the direction we want it to go, which usually requires a model and understanding that spans several interventions and their interactions. Interventions can be seen as efforts or action(s) intended to secure a desired outcome or to change an outcome. In summary, with a systems perspective, we learn a lot about understanding a situation and mapping the landscape of influences and with designing, we learn a lot about the practical ways to take action and to build prototypes getting us closer to solutions that will make a difference. But it needs a structured framework that people can use that gets them to think deeply, to care about the ‘problem’, to understand the systems and then re-design solutions within their sphere of influence, and to being cognisant of potential knock-on effects, intended or else. In other words, a systems perspective brings the connections and designing brings action and reflection. Designing with a systems perspective combines ways of seeing plus ways of doing, to get us beyond understanding, to get us going.
The Current Context
The importance to adopt an engineering systems perspective in changing the world can be introduced by considering the current state of technology in the world, that is, the current context engineers work in. This context can be captured by two overall
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 9


developments that are taking place in the application of technology and by two challenges that technology is facing today. These two developments are shifts from local to global and from separated to interconnected. These developments are to some extent sequential but cumulative, and are resulting into the interlinking of virtually all applications of technology. And it is this interlinking that makes the engineering systems perspective a powerful perspective to understand our current technological fabric. Against this background, the two overall challenges engineers face today are that of sustainability and of digitalisation. The problems of climate change and of the depletion of resources caused by the current technological fabric have to be dealt with urgently, and digitalisation is seen as a necessary step in making the manufacturing of new applications of technology more efficient and sustainable.
Two Connected Developments: From Local to Global and from Separated to Interconnected
The first overall development we witness today is from local to global. Approaching our problems and challenges in a local fashion alone will not be without global ramifications. And conversely, global developments have significant local impacts. In the past, improvements of human existence or increases of productivity were typically realised by local solutions. Technology offered such solutions and for that we developed mechanical engineering and later software engineering and mechatronic engineering approaches for providing one solution at a time: agricultural and construction equipment, steam engines, combustion engines, automotive industry, and aerospace and defence systems. Or changes in behaviour offered solutions to our problems, as crop rotation, hygiene policies, workflow management, and service design. It became clear that these two approaches of technology development and behavioural change were interdependent, leading to a merger of technology and human behaviour, reaching a new category of complexity in engineering. This pushed us into the realm of technical systems engineering, where technology and their operators, regulators, and users collaborate in complex sociotechnical systems that are developed, managed, and maintained with the combined competence of experts from a broad variety of fields in engineering and the social sciences. We are now witnessing the rise of a new era in our approach to problems and challenges – or perhaps we should rather say our approach to creating opportunities and transformations – that requires us to reconcile local and global developments and design decisions. The second development is that our already highly complex sociotechnical systems stop to be separated systems by becoming co-dependent on one another and functionally as well as technically highly integrated. For example, logistics operations no longer only depend on land, air and sea transport systems, but also on space-based satellite positioning systems. Healthcare relies nowadays on professional human care and policy, as well as on high tech chemistry and ICT systems. And the automotive sector is now becoming a major factor in making our energy system more sustainable by load levelling of electricity demands. Nowadays,

products and services are becoming increasingly embedded in systems consisting of technical artefacts, humans and social organisations. These systems are sociotechnical engineering systems. The design of a new product or service or experience is not anymore just a local change but also a global engineering system change. Many of the problems we currently face is requiring global changes to engineering systems. The underlying mechanism is the interconnectedness and truly global nature of our problems and challenges: Starting with nuclear arms introducing us to the idea of a global Armageddon, we have now realised that we all share the same climate, the same natural resources, a highly integrated economical system and our responsibility for global sustainability goals. Today, more than ever, we are designing in an era of systems. This drive to the global motivates the sociotechnical engineering systems perspective. Engineering systems are partially designed, partially evolved (De Weck et al. 2011: 31) integrations of already highly complex systems, for example by integrating the energy and transport systems, to enable sustainable transport (i.e., electrification of transport) as well as sustainable energy generation (i.e., buffering electricity by utilising capacity of transportation system). System interconnectedness becomes especially tangible in emergency situations or adverse incidents where system responses and various uncertainties can be observed. Two examples from energy and food follow: Electricity system failures are pushing the resilience of electricity systems due to knock-on effects to other systems, with energy networks such as electricity, heat, gas as linked also to transport- and communication networks. To illustrate interconnectedness, an example of a system failure is the UK August 2019 transmission system frequency event, which saw more than a million customers disconnected from the electricity system. In this event one generator came of the electrical system for good reasons but created issues with voltage that in turn caused other equipment hick-ups. This perturbation then caused trains to stop, and these trains could not move again when the power got back on, needing real people to start them up again (MacIver et al. 2021). Interconnectedness can also mean that a systemic solution might have the potential to address and potentially solve multiple problems simultaneously. Illustrating with an example from the food sector, one might for instance envisage change from large-scale industrial, chemical agriculture to community-based, organic, sustainable farming. It would contribute to solving three of our biggest problems: reduce our energy dependence, healthy, organically grown food would have a positive effect on public health as many chronic diseases are linked to our diet, and organic farming would contribute significantly to fighting climate change because organic carbon-rich soil would draw more CO2 from the atmosphere (Capra and Luisi 2012). The implications of separate engineering systems becoming increasingly interconnected is that the design of interventions in one engineering system becomes dependent not just on the current technological state and social constellation in that specific engineering system but also on (changes in) the technological state and social constellations of other interconnected engineering systems. And many of the
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 11


inabilities we currently have with resolving problems – and paradoxically precisely also the levers we currently have – are due to the interconnectedness of engineering systems, with unintended knock-on and knock-back effects of changes in one engineering system cascading through other engineering systems. Causality is not anymore seen as a directional effect, but as a bidirectional one, moving from connectedness, to interdependence, to interconnectedness.
Two Current Challenges: Sustainability and Digitalisation
Both sustainability and digitalisation present new and unique challenges – as well as new and unique opportunities. Conversations on sustainability are typically problem-driven: We are exceeding our planetary boundaries, we act socially irresponsibly, and we pursue short-term thinking in our economic decisions. These are framed as the large problem of our time that must be solved – expressed, for example, through the interlinked and nested United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – and we subsequently enact large transformation programs in their pursuit. But they also create new opportunities: organisations that master sustainability – from companies to countries – offer a significantly increased value proposition to their clients. Engineering companies, for example, that can offer you nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change impacts on your house and factory, are creating markets that others cannot even compete in. While our sustainability challenges stem from our ‘success’ of industrialisation over the last 200 years, digitalisation has a different history: Conversations on digitalisation typically start with the opportunities it offers in creating new services and experiences, and increasing the productivity of existing ones. Stemming from our need to advance our tools in developing and providing modern engineering and service activities with increased computational power, the conversations today paint pictures of digital twins of not only products, systems, and services, but also of humans and parts of our society in the ‘metaverse’. Digitalisation is thus both a tool to increase productivity and accessibility of existing products and services, and also an enabler to create new categories of products, services, and ultimately, experiences. The single most powerful driver of digitalisation is its inherent connectedness – the creation of the internet has reduced digital – not environmental transaction costs to practically zero. Digitalisation then, however, is also discussed emphasising the challenges it presents: Its global, connected and real-time nature creates novel challenges in shaping a productive public discourse, in fighting crime, in keeping critical infrastructure safe, or in stopping exploitation of vulnerable populations.
Sustainability
This is a decisive decade for the future of a humane society. The stable functioning of Earth systems – including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterways, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles – is a prerequisite for a thriving global society. With the human population set to rise to 9 billion by 2050, sustainable development needs to
12 A. Maier et al.


include the security of people and the planet and show the dynamic interconnections and interdependencies. We are responsible for the current state of affairs, and so we are also responsible for re-thinking our approach to and managing human and natural resources to address the sustainability challenge. It is increasingly acknowledged that our current technological and social systems are not sustainable, requiring too many resources for their development and maintenance. The challenges to make sociotechnical engineering systems sustainable have to be understood in relation to the two overall developments of engineering systems becoming more global and more interconnected: impacts of technical interventions have in the past not always been sensible or understood or accepted; and this understanding is a precondition to making engineering systems sustainable. Whole systems change has to include changes in behaviour, in infrastructures, in policy, in ethics, and in designing processes for forming collaborative partnerships for achieving the global goals. Sustainability – environmental, social, and economic – has to be seen as a pathway to regeneration where we learn how to give back more than we take. We need regeneration, need recovery, need building back. We need pathways to achieving net zero targets, or even better, to achieving net positive targets. Achieving net zero energy means producing, from renewable resources, as much energy on site as is used over the course of a year. Achieving net positive energy means producing, from renewable resources, more energy on site than is used over the course of a year. An illustrative example of how a systems perspective linking engineering and technology, behaviour, and policy is necessary is the challenge of low carbon energy, thinking across energy production, distribution, storage, and consumption. A whole systems approach to decarbonisation is being advocated (National Engineering Policy Centre 2020), with the energy system sitting within a wider system of multiple social-, technical and environmental factors. A lot of reduction we have seen is through the supply side, through technology measures. Yet, further reduction depends on change in the demand side and that depends on societal or behavioural changes. This can be challenging especially when there can be conflicts between individual goals, such as energy provision and climate-change prevention (Midgley and Lindhult 2021; Cabrera et al. 2021). If and when we reach a situation where human energy consumption becomes sustainable, it will mean the end of the current situation where new innovations that involve increased energy consumption inevitably play their part in adding to the cumulative effects of carbon emissions and ultimately climate change. Another example is the challenge of how we might achieve sustainable mobility. Functioning transport systems are one of the key drivers of our prosperity. Yet, the steady rise in demand for mobility is putting an ever-increasing strain on our environment, climate and infrastructure. Finding intelligent, environmentally friendly forms of mobility for the future is a significant challenge. Today, people take mobility for granted. But we can face an enormous challenge: how can we satisfy the ever-increasing demand for transport while simultaneously achieving zero CO2 emissions? Shall we automate? Shall we optimise mobility behaviour? Shall we increase capacity? Other directions? The point is that different propositions have
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 13


different consequences. Over the last 250 years, humankind has always succeeded in meeting its growing demand for mobility by pioneering new technologies and building the necessary transport infrastructure. Is this the path we shall continue to follow? The more sophisticated the transport network, the more complex and expensive it is to expand. We might opt for tunnelling underground or taking to the air – with drones for instance. Another proposition might be to restrict access, e.g., stricter regulation by means of road pricing systems? Yet another option may be to enhance energy efficiency. Energy consumption is falling thanks to more efficient combustion engines, hybrid technology and lighter vehicles – and the potential for further efficiency gains is promised. Shall we use the strategy of replacement? If we are to reach our global climate targets, replacing fossil fuels with renewables is a proposal on the table. As such, electromobility, powered by renewable energy presents itself as an option, hydrogen and synthetic fuels produced using renewable energy are another option, yet, it takes a lot of energy to produce hydrogen, and even more to manufacture synthetic fuels. The core of the matter is to allow for multiple possible paths, including low-tech paths, and to allow for multiple time horizons. The engineering systems perspective encourages thinking through and designing alternative scenarios for the future and “analysing their sensitivity to errors in the theory and data [. . .] for an acceptable future for the energy and environmental needs of a society” (Simon 1981: 171).
Digitalisation
One way in which engineering systems become increasingly interconnected is through information and telecommunications technologies (ICT systems). These systems have enabled the modelling of the state of separate engineering systems and the subsequent exchange of information between these systems. This development is currently accelerated for improving the efficiency of engineering systems and for taking up the first challenge of making these systems sustainable. The digitalisation challenge includes making the interconnections of engineering systems manageable. The world economy as well as societies are going through a digital transformation that goes well beyond computerisation and use of information and telecommunications technologies. Digital transformation as the integration of digital technology into all areas of business and life is fundamentally changing how organisations operate and deliver value. It is also a cultural change that requires organisations to continually challenge the status quo, experiment, and get comfortable with failure. This transformation is creating opportunities and challenges. Some technological advancements that are opening opportunities include lightspeed internet, supplementing existing fibre optic networks, allowing, for example, applications such as telepresence, multiplayer games and musicians playing together online. Thanks to new technologies, especially the Internet of Things (IoT), new concepts such as Digital Twinning have been able to make production for manufacturing companies much easier and more efficient. A Digital Twin is a virtual replica of physical assets, whether this is a product, service, or process. It collects, analyses and monitors data and simulates any potential problems that might occur
14 A. Maier et al.


before they do in reality, saving costs and time needed for maintenance and increasing productivity. The Digital Twin is nowadays an instrumental part of every Smart Factory, and we see applications across many sectors, especially in health. Within smart manufacturing, we see applications for predictive maintenance, accident prevention, tracking and restocking inventory, tracing the product journey, getting real-time feedback and other deep knowledge about the processes inside a plant and industry know-how. An application can learn more or less anything. But it needs a good teacher. And this is where it links to ethics and responsibility. Manufacturing is just one example. Digitalisation of society is pervasive, opening many fundamental questions of resources and responsibility. Whilst digitalisation and digital transformations are by some praised as the saviour, it opens up questions about equity of access, about its connection to socially sustainable futures, of inclusiveness of societies. Digitalisation exposes disparities and also creates new ones. What technology literacy does it take in the future? The dark side is also exposed through increased vulnerabilities, e.g., hacking access into vital infrastructure, increasing the power gap between rich and poor countries, old secrets will become known, impact financial systems, new weapons that should never see the light of day, governments losing their grip on criminal organisations, government becoming less transparent, governments gaining too much control over their citizens, increasing power of large tech companies etc. Digitalisation on human lives with its pervasiveness as never seen before, opens deep questions along the safety/security nexus on ethics and on responsibility. A central challenge of global and ubiquitous digitalisation is – in a surprising way – its incredible success. Today, our private lives are digital, our workplace is digital, and our critical infrastructure is digital. This has created an entirely new set of risks – cascading cyber-physical safety risks, where ‘digital accidents’ or digital attacks lead to wide-spread physical destruction and loss of human life. It has also created new niches in our existing risk landscape – international crime takes advantage of encrypted real time communication channels, sells drugs and weapons online, exploits vulnerable populations, defrauds pensioners, and blackmails companies and public organisations. What makes digitalisation so powerful – its global network, flexible and open architectures, and instantaneous communication – also makes it dangerous. This creates new design imperatives for enabling and ensuring human-led digitalisation for making digitalisation safe and secure by design.
Interventions in Engineering Systems: By Design
A central proposition advanced in this Handbook is that engineering has developed a sociotechnical engineering systems perspective on our world by which change in our world can be realised through designing interventions in these engineering systems. Engineering systems design affects technological, environmental, behavioural and as such societal change. One of the essential tasks in designing interventions from a systems perspective is boundary scoping, that is, clearly specifying a system’s boundary to define its scale and scope (De Weck et al. 2011: 51). Demarcating the
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 15


system is defining the boundaries of that part of the material world that needs to be considered, and establishing how its structures and functions can be changed or stabilised (Züst and Troxler 2006: 51). Boundary scoping is important as we need to understand the knock-on effects and as we also need to re-adjust the means given potentially changing contexts and goals through life. Simon formulates it dynamically we are “designing without final goals” (Simon 1981: 185). Especially given today’s complex context just sketched above, it is hard to imagine true ‘green field design’. We are always building on something, re-designing, engaging in ‘brown field design’. Systems are partially (intentionally) designed, partially evolved. We take the two developments from local to global and separated to connected to imply that engineering in the twenty-first century is about intervening in existing complex situations by multidisciplinary engineering systems design. Designing is doing and designing interventions ‘moves’ a system, stipulates a modification, a change, and effects. Interventions can take the form of adjusting existing products, services, experiences or incorporating new products and services or experiences into the existing engineering systems fabric. Products and services are seen as interventions themselves. Engineering is therefore in the twenty-first century concerned with complex systems containing technical systems, humans, their behaviour, and their social organisations and regulatory frameworks, which evolve under uncertainty due to their complexity and interconnectedness. This presents significant challenges: Designing interventions to ‘improve’ evolved, existing engineering systems; operating and managing them best; and creating sociotechnical solutions that incorporate both complex technical aspects, as well as a wide range of organisational and behavioural aspects. In our considered opinion, engineering systems not only represent a quantitative increase in design and sociotechnical engineering challenges, but also a qualitative one. In the engineering systems perspective, the tasks of designing new solutions should now be seen as designing interventions to existing and ‘living’ engineering systems. Designing these interventions includes designing technologies, guiding and aligning people that are part of the systems as users, operators and regulators, and proactively responding to national and international policies that are in place or should be put in place for enabling the existence and operation of engineering systems. And this designing cannot be done from scratch, as the currently operating engineering systems provides critical societal values. Creating autonomous vehicles consists not just of designing a car with intelligent technology for navigation but includes also, for instance, the adjustment of the existing road infrastructure, creations of means for control and trust by users and authorities, and adjustment of insurance practices and liability legislation. Creating autonomous vehicles is therefore better approached as an intervention in the existing transportation-related engineering system, rather than as the design of a new technology. Technology is one essential element within engineering systems, and arguable the element that is currently best understood. Three elements which need additional consideration for dealing with the challenges of designing, managing and shaping enabling policies of engineering systems are complexity, human behaviour and uncertainty.
16 A. Maier et al.


That technical complexity impacts organisational complexity is well known since the Apollo programme. However, we do not currently have an answer to the level of both technical as well as (socio-)organisational complexity that we are witnessing in engineering systems. This is compounded by two additional factors. First, human behaviour and its adaptive nature and global stakeholders and their influence create dynamics in and impose constraints on engineering systems additional to technological constraints, and for handling them we need new approaches. Second, we are faced with engineering systems that, arguably, have an indefinite life span, and that by their integration co-evolve with each other. This generates significant uncertainty when adjusting or creating an engineering system for realising new technological opportunities. Redesigning, say, the energy system for making it more sustainable, now requires understanding and controlling shifts in human behaviour and (geo)politics, as well as developments in related engineering systems as transport.
Advantages, Concerns, and a Look to the Future of Engineering Systems Design
The engineering systems perspective brings significant advantages to designing a more humane world. Yet it also raises concerns and leads to a number of questions. In this section we expand on these advantage and issues.
The Advantages of Taking an Engineering Systems Design Perspective
Taking an engineering systems perspective and aiming at changes by designing interventions in these engineering systems has a number of advantages. It combines holistic ways of seeing and structured ways of doing, and in this way enables industry, academia, policy making and civil society to address the problems our current world is confronted with. Firstly, an engineering systems perspective gives engineers, policymakers, and others insights into systems and how they operate. It sets systems thinking central in designing, which broadens engineering with systems thinking and as such enables seeing connections and asking the right questions before embarking on solutions. This, in turn, puts emphasis on connections and interactions, such as between technology and human behaviour or between technology and social institutions. Moreover, it emphasises the complexity of and the uncertainty in the development of engineering systems and reminds us all to consider emergent properties and the dynamics of engineering systems over time. What this means is to let go of the hope for well-defined, fixed design briefs. Instead, we need to dare to embrace complex challenges with dynamic situations and constantly moving targets. There is no single way of taking an engineering systems approach. There are multiple methods and tools, yet a shared focus on understanding the whole system, recognising that it is complex, and has emergent properties that arise from the way different elements

interact, irrespective of whether the system studied is a company, a city, a rail network, a service, or a whole industry sector. Placing systems thinking at the centre and focusing on connections and dynamics thereby alerts engineers to consider potential side-effects, which can emerge lateral as through knock-on effects in the interconnected engineering systems and can emerge temporal as through longer life cycles of engineering systems. Secondly, an engineering systems design perspective allows decision makers in industry, academia, policy, and civil society more widely to consider behaviours and interactions between different parts of the system, and how these can combine to affect an outcome. A whole systems approach enables decision makers to understand the complex challenges, e.g., posed by targets that demand designing under resource constraints. Designing engineering systems interventions can be seen a discovery process combining structured approaches quantitative and qualitative to understanding and managing technical and physical factors such as infrastructure and novel or advanced technologies with broader perspectives on regulatory, financial, behavioural and other factors, taking into account complex interactions. Overall, an engineering systems perspective helps to consider technical factors, including material technical infrastructure and helps to realise their embeddedness in social systems of the behaviours, attitudes, institutional structures and social economics. Such sociotechnical relationships influence how the overall system functions and how overall, system behaviour evolves, in both desirable and undesirable ways. Thirdly, an engineering systems approach offers concrete means for framing and modelling what-if scenarios, for anticipating alternative futures and multiple configurations in the network of reinforcing and balancing loops of influencing factors (Sterman 2000). Mapping, modelling, what-if scenario envisaging interconnections are important analytical techniques as part of a systems approach. A model provides the ability to identify the next question, progressively to improve one’s understanding and reflecting on the weakness of the model. A model is aid for thinking and understanding. Different areas of specialist knowledge can come together and interdependencies among them can be drawn. For example, with respect to regulatory and commercial structures we are working within and the extent to which they act as barriers to what people have identified of what needs to be done and with respect to what is the scope and responsibilities of institutions and actors to getting things done. This is then used as a working assumption about how an intervention might alter the current situation. Models enhance the quality of democratic decisionmaking. They can offer cost-benefit analyses of various policy options, manage risk and uncertainty, or predict how economic and social factors might change in the future. Modelling approaches and other design techniques such as scenario planning (for exploring alternative approaches and test policy robustness) and deliberative system mapping. This will build a better understanding of social and behavioural dimensions and how technologies work at scale. Techniques such as system maps help to bring stakeholder views such as citizens in. Understanding citizens’ journeys and taking time to understand the dimensions of a situation is as much about the process, thinking about the elements and interactions than it is about the systems

map that is drawn and co-created. Techniques such as system maps are tools for engagement and give opportunities for conversations. It is about systems thinking in its broadest sense, not system mapping as a specific technique per se. It is the social activity around system mapping that gets people involved, enables a more co-ordinated strategy, and asks for stewardship of people with the artificial world and the natural world. Finally, thinking through more local interventions whilst being mindful of global ripple effects, has the advantage for mobilisation through multiple initiatives for systems change. Intervening is giving impulses with a sustainable futures perspective forward.
Some Concerns Regarding Engineering Systems Design
The engineering systems perspective also brings some concerns. We present three and discuss ways to approach them. A first concern is the tension between the engineering systems perspective and the way we describe innovation. The last few decades have been ones in which many innovations saw the light of day, broadly characterised by digital technologies and servitisation, and punctuated with the introduction of the world wide web, smart phones, and social media. Daily and professional life as we know it today is at many points substantially different to life in the 1980s, and these changes and novelties seem at first sight difficult to capture within the engineering systems perspective. According to De Weck et al. (2011), engineering systems cannot be radically changed by design, for instance since changes are constrained by the legacy of existing structures, software and hardware currently part of these systems. Engineering systems are said to be changing partly by design and partly by evolution, which is also the reason to speak in this Handbook of design interventions in existing engineering systems, rather than of their design from scratch. It follows that innovators, like, say, Thomas Edison, could at most have changed local aspects of existing engineering systems, a conclusion that sits less well with how many of us see innovation. A response to this concern is a description of technology development in engineering systems that accounts in some way for more standard views on innovation. One option is to criticise the ways in which people see innovation. It may be argued that innovation does not exist of punctuated events in technology development driven by breakthrough inventions or iconic visions. In that response, adopted in, for instance, history of technology (Basalla 1989), innovations are analysed as longer-term accumulations of smaller changes, shifting the focus on series of smaller design interventions: the smartphone is then just the integration of a series of existing functionalities and thus the result of a many earlier designs, rather than a magical gift by Steve Jobs. A second option for a response is to find within accounts of engineering systems the conceptual recourses for capturing the ways in which people standardly see innovation. The concept of tipping point is then a candidate to consider. Initially meant to express those systems that are well manageable at one

point can all of a sudden spin out of control, one could apply it also to intentional change. One could argue that a series of design interventions in engineering systems can bring a system to a rapid transition from its existing state to a newly envisaged one. By this second approach, the smartphone is indeed the sum of a series of earlier designs. Yet, when it was presented, this sum of designs had in a short period of time radically impacted on the communication engineering system and by extension, societal interaction patterns. A second concern may be a return to a naïve optimism with the engineering systems perspective. We started this introduction with noting that humane societies seem to be stuck with effectively addressing the major problems of our times and presented the engineering systems perspective as a way to navigate and cut through the impasse. Yet this proposition should be critically approached. Engineering was throughout the last centuries presented and seen as the way forward to improve the human condition, and in the 1960s even advanced as able to provide solutions to social problems (Weinberg 1967). The term that captures this promise was “technological fix” and soon became, just as the prediction it was based on that (nuclear) technology would create very cheap energy resources, a synonym of engineering hubris and also naivety. The proposition that societal problems can be addressed when taking the engineering systems perspective should not be adopted with similar naïve optimism. Instead, this proposition should be met with a critical approach aimed as evaluating and demarcating where the engineering systems perspective may work and where it may not. Design interventions based on more sophisticated analyses of our world may become more effective in addressing our societal problem, yet notwithstanding all claims to the contrary: societal problems remain wicked problems to design to which design has no ‘fixes’ (Vermaas and Pesch 2020). We do posit that the engineering systems perspective is an important new development within engineering that takes account of the connected and evolving nature of society, yet it should not be interpreted as offering “socio-technological fixes’ to our problems. A third, related, concern is the recognition that also interventions created with the engineering systems approach will have unintended consequences. Any intervention can have unintended consequences, and engineering systems design is not exempted from that; it will be more useful to anticipate those consequences. For engineering systems design, consequences may occur at both the technical level and the societal level, through direct impact on the systems intervened in, or through knock-on effects on other engineering systems. A response to this concern may be to see engineering systems design as more ongoing processes rather than as individual projects with a beginning and an end date. From the global perspective that comes with engineering systems, this shift in seeing engineering systems design seems obvious, since engineering systems such as the electrical grid and the civil aviation system are systems that are constantly maintained and developed by design interventions. But also from a more local perspective, suggestions are made that design is developing towards a more ongoing effort in which the unintended consequences of interventions are constantly monitored and topic of further design interventions (Dorst 2019).
20 A. Maier et al.


The sketched approach to the latter concern leads to a question of coordination of design interventions in engineering systems, and is one of the open questions in the engineering systems perspective, to which we now turn.
Open Questions for the Future
The Handbook provides foundational concepts to designing for societal transitions, and it leads to our observation of five larger open questions that need posing and need addressing. In ▶ Chapter 35, “Engineering Systems Design: A Look to the Future”, of the Handbook, we return to these questions and provide our thoughts about possible answers to some. First, the above-mentioned question of how to organise the coordination of design interventions is an open question from the engineering systems perspective. On the local level, the ongoing monitoring and developing of (the local part of) an engineering system can be coordinated with standard management tools. For coordinating design interventions that occur in parallel and successively across the globe, more thinking is needed to arrive at meaningful and efficient coordination. Second, an engineering systems perspective demands to think about the future. Whilst this seems obvious, it comes far from naturally. Why the way we think about the future matters is because it plays a fundamental role both at conscious and unconscious levels in shaping the decisions we take now. A systems approach to the future means anticipation of the future, i.e., the potential impacts of decisions and knock-on effects of interventions in the web of interconnections. As such, the foremost open questions are: How might we train ourselves to think systemically about the future? How might we learn to act systemically for the future? Taking an engineering systems perspective is a through life learning journey. Third, finding new ways to live within the resource constraints of the planet, creating acceptable futures for the energy and environmental needs of society, will require system integration, cumulative change across multiple sectors, including transport, manufacturing, agriculture, and the built environment. Rapid technology development and ensuing implications will occur in the next decades and the developments will need integration and coherent governance structures. This opens challenging questions that potentially erode our well-proven mental models of growth. Is it time to thoroughly re-think or re-cycle the economic growth model? What are the implications for us as scientists, engineers, politicians, educators, citizens? Fourth, when addressing practitioners or scholars alike, we need to ask ourselves who is the client and who is the designer? Or, who are the clients and who are the designers? For engineers, it might seem strange to ask such questions. Yet, how might we answer such questions for the (re-)design of large sociotechnical systems that the Handbook is about? Society is the client, or, accepting plurality in our current world, societies are the clients. And we all are designers. Each and every one of us has to play that role. How might we raise awareness that responsibility lies with everyone? Consequences and implications of our actions originating in the past,
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 21


taken now, implicate future generations. Hence, linking to the above, we need to train ourselves to lead from the future, to become system stewards. This challenges us all, as it impacts deeply on personal levels to change our behaviours. Fifth, open questions include how we might bring latest research insights together with practice-based implementation. If we want to educate leaders, we have to take a larger point of view, a systems point of view. If we want to empower engineers in positions of authority, we need to change engineers education towards a more balanced educational model, throughout the life cycle of a person’s career, starting with school and university. Engineering systems design is through life learning. This also means creating a skilled workforce, upskilling, re-skilling across work sectors, across work disciplines. We all need new skillsets of how we think and talk about situations, about potential solutions. What perspectives we highlight, regardless of talent, knowledge, time, technological foundations, and investment, we need to create valuable opportunities for collaborations ahead. And in this, one of the main open questions then is: How do we learn and train our ability to connect, and disconnect for that matter, i.e., to master connectability? This Handbook provides a glimpse into the bodies of knowledge in engineering systems design, augmenting retrospective or short-term sensemaking (Weick 1995) with prospective or long-term meaning making (Vorre Hansen and Madsen 2019: 93). The chapters in the Handbook written by experts give many answers in the form of propositions, methods, and tools and provide conjectures as food for thought and calls to action going forward. In the next section we give an overview of the different chapters in the Handbook. And in ▶ Chapter 35, “Engineering Systems Design: A Look to the Future”, we return in a more explorative manner to the overall challenges our society faces and to the prospects of addressing them by engineering systems design.
Content: The State of the Art of Engineering Systems Design in Five Parts
The Handbook is an authoritative compendium and reference source on Engineering Systems Design written by leading experts in the field. It is written for scholars as well as practitioners interested in transforming society. It is for research- and education-, for industry- and policy leaders. The Handbook provides a comprehensive, cumulative summary of major approaches being used in studies of engineering systems design, the state-of-the-art and findings resulting from the approaches. The Handbook serves both to define the field ‘as it is’ and provides a point of departure for subsequent work. Each chapter provides a comprehensive review about the specific topic of the chapter and lays the foundation for follow-on work. The breadth of this summary is not indicative of the entire range of possibilities of engineering systems design, esp. at the intersection and interplay between engineering and social sciences, but rather instead, a representative sampling. The information presented is based on state-of-the-art compiled and set in perspective by leading authors across the globe and across scientific disciplines. Wherever possible, the Handbook is
22 A. Maier et al.


illustrated with real or worked examples from contributors who have considerable relevant experience of aspects of engineering systems design processes. The Handbook of Engineering Systems Design is composed of five parts. The first part starts with the basics of the engineering systems perspective. The second part covers the core characteristics of engineering systems. The third part deals with designing interventions. The fourth part reflects on the developments and leading thoughts to-date, calls to action forward, and introduces a number of cases in the health and transport sectors. The fifth part concludes with a look to the future.
Part I: The Engineering Systems Perspective
PART I The Engineering Systems Perspective presents the academic roots of engineering systems design and includes a discussion on the ‘Zeitgeist’, i.e., sustainable and digital as central topics, and anchors systems thinking and systems-led design as base for how an engineering systems perspective provides solution opportunities for complex societal challenges. This first chapter gives the editors’ perspectives on engineering systems design and its societal importance. Maier et al. highlight the opportunities through designing interventions taking a systems perspective and give a synopsis of each chapter in the Handbook. In ▶ Chapter 2, “History of Engineering Systems Design Research and Practice”, a review of the historical developments in engineering systems design from antiquity to the present day is given. McMahon notes especially the continual increase in recent years in the sophistication and interconnectedness of engineered artefacts, and development, from the late nineteenth century, of vast networks for energy, communications, and transportation. ▶ Chapter 3, “Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes for Engineering Systems Design” introduces several well-established design accounts. Isaksson et al. discuss how each approach offers valuable insights that help to address different aspects of complex systems design. In ▶ Chapter 4, “The Evolution of Complex Engineering Systems”, the notion of sociotechnical engineering systems evolving over generations of products and policies and of long-life cycles over many decades is described, and tram transportation in the UK and Germany is used as illustration. Eckert and Clarkson explain the evolution of systems, highlighting path dependency, which explains how future designs are restricted by decisions taken in the past, and engineering change, which handles the effects of a change on parts of the system and neighbouring systems. ▶ Chapter 5, “Sustainable Futures from an Engineering Systems Perspective” provides an overview of key sustainability developments in the past, which have laid the foundation for how engineering systems can contribute to a sustainable future through holistic sociotechnical design. McAloone and Hauschild describe core concepts including planetary boundaries and circularity and overall address the question how systems approaches can contribute to sustainability goals. Following sustainability, another major topic is reviewed: ▶ Chapter 6, “Digitalisation of Society”. The chapter includes digitisation as mainly referring to implications of digital technologies and digitalisation covering changes in society more widely, including business and governmental organisations. Spath et al.,

highlight opportunities through Industry 4.0 for industrial sectors such as mechanical engineering or the automotive industry in particular. Concluding Part 1 of the Handbook, ▶ Chapter 7, “Systems Thinking: Practical Insights on Systems-Led Design in Socio-technical Engineering Systems” describes fundamental concepts of systems thinking and introduces systems-led design. Kaur and Craven point out that systems thinking has gained momentum helping to understand and respond to complex phenomena and illustrate by application to the challenge of tax system design at the Australian Taxation Office.
Part II: Describing Engineering Systems
PART II Describing Engineering Systems builds on the Handbook’s underlying systems perspective, provides foundational concepts, and moves to describing the core challenges and characteristics of engineering systems, namely, technical and social complexity, multifacetedness of human behaviour, uncertainty and dynamics of long lifecycles, and core properties of engineering systems, sometimes referred to as ilities or non-functional requirements. In ▶ Chapter 8, “Technical and Social Complexity”, key drivers of complexity are identified and analysed, including increased interconnectedness amongst systems constituents (network complexity) and multi-level decision-making (multi-agent complexity). Heydari and Herder argue for complexity management instead of complexity reduction and see the introduction of AI into engineering systems playing a significant role in managing complexity and effective governance of such systems. Connecting to complexity management from the human vantage point, ▶ Chapter 9, “Human Behaviour, Roles, and Processes” focuses on the user, the designer in an interdisciplinary exchange with different stakeholders as experts from different disciplines, such as managers, software systems engineers, mechanical systems engineers, and many more involved in the engineering systems design process. Badke-Schaub and Schaub emphasise that understanding human behaviour is important to conceive why people make certain decisions and why other people do not make decisions at all, and highlight requirements, needs, and safety as guiding principles for the system development process. ▶ Chapter 10, “Risk, Uncertainty, and Ignorance in Engineering Systems Design” emphasises uncertainty as the third major challenge in understanding and designing engineering systems, together with complexity and human behaviour. Oehmen and Kwakkel provide an overview of managerial practices to address the three levels of increasing uncertainty in engineering systems design: from managing risk, to managing uncertainty, to managing ignorance. The authors of the chapter conclude with a call to action to embrace resilience as a core design objective, both in terms of achieving technical resilience and supporting societal resilience, and thus cohesion through engineering systems design. Concluding Part II of the Handbook, ▶ Chapter 11, “Properties of Engineering Systems” focuses especially on desired engineering system properties and their relevance to designing effective interventions that ultimately result in sustainable value delivery to society. Rhodes and Ross present the definition of property as an attribute, quality, or
24 A. Maier et al.


characteristic of something, provide an overview of many such properties and highlight four that have been widely recognised in traditional engineering, namely: quality, safety, usability/operability, and maintainability/reliability.
Part III: Designing Engineering Systems Interventions
Part III Designing Engineering Systems Interventions describes the process of designing interventions from planning and analysing, to developing and implementing, to evaluating and testing their impact, and covers the tasks related to designing interventions in engineering systems. It operationalises what the previous two parts have laid out in terms of overall goals, context, and the specific challenges that engineering systems pose. The core challenge is that, while engineering systems are highly complex and integrated systems, effectively they are changed through one (or a handful) of their elements and interrelations at a time. While we recognise the potential benefits of centrally ‘managed’ engineering systems, their de-facto decentralised nature requires us to develop methods allowing us to work on and improve the global performance of engineering systems through mostly localised changes, whilst trying to anticipate the potential ripple effects. In ▶ Chapter 12, “Engineering Systems Design Goals and Stakeholder Needs”, we start the (re-)design process with the topics of understanding stakeholder needs and formulating engineering system design goals. McKay et al. introduce three overarching approaches to the design of engineering systems (userdriven design, designer-driven design, and systems engineering) and provide examples of their application to practical design work through three cases at different levels of scale: the design of a surgical device, the design of a knowledge management system, and designing in response to sustainable development goals. From there, ▶ Chapter 13, “Architecting Engineering Systems: Designing Critical Interfaces” logically flows with a discussion on system architecture, understood as the fundamental structure of a system as a focal point where novel designs are discussed, often in terms of integrating new technologies into existing system architectures. Jankovic and Hein emphasise the key aspect of addressing system architecture is identifying, modelling, and managing critical interfaces. The concept of system of system is introduced and examples from aerospace as well as space flight are given. In ▶ Chapter 14, “Data-Driven Preference Modelling in Engineering Systems Design”, data-driven approaches for multistakeholder decision-making in engineering systems design are discussed, including value-based models, agent-based models, and network-based models for heterogeneous customer preference modelling. Chen et al. provide two case studies on vehicle systems design to highlight the steps of network-based customer preference modelling and to demonstrate its advantages in visualising and modelling the complex interdependencies among different entities in a design ecosystem for data-driven design interventions. Having focused on system analysis in this part of the Handbook so far, the next chapter now turns to system development, starting with the topic of ▶ Chapter15, “Formulating Engineering Systems Requirements”, essential to coordinate purposedriven activities distributed over several stakeholders. Zimmermann and De Weck
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 25


focus on requirements from both a receiver’s and a provider’s perspective and provide an overview of approaches to requirements management from elicitation, analysis, triage, specification as well as verification and validation and of typical forms of documentation and formulation rules. A summary of quantitative requirements analysis methods rounds off the chapter, with emphasis on simulation, isoperformance analysis, analytical target cascading, and solution space optimisation. In ▶ Chapter 16, “Designing for Human Behaviour in a Systemic World” an overview and synthesis of theories and examples of behavioural interventions available to designers is discussed, from fields spanning the natural-, social-, behavioural-, health-, and technical sciences. Maier and Cash review literature from two perspectives ‘technology-first’, where technology is the primary driver of design, and ‘human-first’, where it is human behaviour that is the focus and driver and from three main levels of intervention: i) individual or micro-, ii) group or mesoand iii) societal- or macro-level. Perspectives and levels are synthesised via a ‘design as connector’ lens, bridging insights ranging from engineering to policy. The authors of the chapter propose four main points of guidance, illustrated by examples from health behaviour, sustainable behaviour, and urban planning. ▶ Chapter 17, “Designing for Technical Behaviour” follows, focusing on strategies for technical design of engineering systems, allowing designers to achieve both technical and business objectives. For achieving both functional properties as well as emergent properties, Panchal and Grogan present an overview of design strategies and their respective strengths, limitations, and trade-offs such as complexity vs. robustness, requirements vs. value, modularity vs. performance, and the interactions between social and technical aspects. Strategies include hierarchical decomposition, modularity, design for emergent behaviours such as design for quality, design for changeability, and, more generally, design for X, modelling and simulation, and optimisation-based strategies. When designing for human- and technical behaviour in a systemic world, core concepts such as dynamics and emergence have to be taken into account. ▶ Chapter 18, “Dynamics and Emergence: Case Examples from Literature” discusses the two core and closely linked concepts with the view towards understanding both the trajectories of evolution of systems and correspondingly the patterns of system behaviour, i.e., comprehending emergence in systems through emphasising the dynamics of interactions. To illustrate, Mansouri and Štorga review and summarise the topics of emergence and dynamics through their applications in six case examples conducted by researchers around the world, representing a portfolio of cases studied with multiple theoretical foundations, levels of scope, application domains of engineering systems design, phenomena of emergence, and modelling methods used that detect and identify emergence through dynamics. From a portfolio of examples from literature, ensuing, ▶ Chapter 19, “Designing for Emergent Safety in Engineering Systems” focuses on emergent safety hazards, i.e., hazards emerging from a system without arising from any part of the system alone, but because of interactions between parts. Taylor and Kozine emphasise approaches that consider such hazards as sociotechnical systems, that is, representation of a system by sequential functionally unrelated processes that can in reality influence the performance of each other via sneak paths and other approaches that consider such
26 A. Maier et al.


hazards as cyber-physical systems that focus on the analysis of control loops (feedback, feedforward, positive and negative) and, especially, interrelated loops. The authors conclude the chapter with general guidance for avoiding and eliminating safety hazards when designing engineering systems. Following designing for sociotechnical safety, ▶ Chapter 20, “Flexibility and Real Options in Engineering Systems Design” describes flexibility as a core system property, providing systems owners and operators with the ability to respond easily and cost-effectively to future changes and to contribute to improved economic value, sustainability and resilience, by enabling systems to adapt and reconfigure in the face of uncertainty in operations, markets, regulations, and technology. Cardin et al. provide an overview of the development of literature in design for flexibility, design frameworks, methods and procedures to support such design activities in practice, with an emphasis on Real Options Analysis, which focuses on quantifying the value of flexibility in largescale, irreversible investment projects. Supporting case studies in aerospace, automotive, energy, real estate, transportation, and water management are presented and key future directions for research are given, involving sustainability and resilience, data-driven real options, empirical studies and simulation games, machine learning, digital twin modelling, and 3D virtualisation. Having gone from system analysis, to system development, the following three chapters move to treating topics of system evaluation. In ▶ Chapter 21, “Engineering Systems in Flux: Designing and Evaluating Interventions in Dynamic Systems”, an overview of state of the art on approaches for designing and evaluating interventions in dynamic systems is provided. Bots discusses strengths and weaknesses of a number of design strategies and highlights exploratory modelling and participatory modelling as methods for ex-ante evaluation of interventions in dynamic engineering systems. This leads to the topic area of ▶ Chapter 22, “Engineering Systems Integration, Testing, and Validation” with the focus on multiple testing approaches, including an introduction to parametric cost models, knowledge gradient algorithms, and the sequencing of tests. Valerdi and Sullivan illustrate the support for decision makers for co-ordinating, prioritising, sequencing, and learning through such testing methods with examples taken from the International Space Station and a drone delivery. To come full circle in the intervention design process, ▶ Chapter 23, “Evaluating Engineering Systems Interventions” discusses two types of engineering system interventions, namely, those that change system behaviour and those that change system structure, and moves to discussing the types of measurement that can be applied to evaluating such interventions, contrasting experimental, data-driven, and model-based approaches. Schoonenberg and Farid conclude the chapter with a taxonomy of engineering system models including graphical models, quantitative structural models, and quantitative behavioural models.
Part IV: Reflecting on Engineering Systems Interventions
Part IV Reflecting on Engineering Systems Interventions raises awareness for potentially underlying biases, including in the way questions are phrased, design methods
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 27


are used, and efforts are organised. Chapters in this part raise awareness for research methods supporting engineering systems design, for learnings with examples from megaproject organising, for the potential biases and consequences of choices, i.e. on the way engineering systems designers choose to conceptualise and frame situations, on what methods and tools they may use, and how interventions may be organised and implemented and what impact this may have, on ethics and equity of access, and on the roles and skills of engineering systems designers forward. ▶ Chapter 24, “Research Methods for Supporting Engineering Systems Design” provides an overview of different methodological paradigms in different disciplinary research traditions. Szajnfarber and Broniatowski review quantitative observational research, including inferential statistics and machine learning, qualitative observations research, theory-informed in vivo and quasi-experiments and mathematical representation-informed in-silico experiments. The authors highlight that different types of conclusions may be drawn from these research approaches and research methods, with a specific focus on the ways such research approaches and research methods seek to guarantee validity and a reflection on respective ensuing implications and conclusions that may be drawn. The authors conclude the chapter by emphasising that engineering systems, with their technical and social, cyber, and physical components interacting, are best understood when studied from multiple methodological lenses simultaneously. ▶ Chapter 25, “Transforming Engineering Systems: Learnings from Organising Megaprojects” follows with a reflection on why is it so hard to design, deliver, and yield long-term benefits from megaprojects as interventions in engineering systems? Grounding the work in the project studies literature, Geraldi and Davis discuss four challenges of managing megaprojects: delivering purposeful interventions, integrating complex work under high levels of uncertainty, collaborating with friends and foes, and innovating and learning under high time and budget constraints. Illustrative examples, including the London 2012 Olympics, The Sydney Opera House, and the Berlin Brandenburg Airport are provided. The following three chapters emphasise the criticality of reflecting on engineering system designers’ choices; choices of asking questions, of choosing means, and of organising efforts. ▶ Chapter 26, “Asking Effective Questions: Awareness of Bias in Designerly Thinking” emphasises that asking effective questions allows the curious mind to learn about the environment around them. Formulation of questions is often affected by cognitive biases and preconceptions, in turn influencing decisions and affecting impact. Price and Lloyd conclude with an appellative question on how we might become more responsible and more conscious designers? ▶ Chapter 27, “Choosing Effective Means: Awareness of Bias in the Selection of Methods and Tools” reviews methodological means in engineering system design and the broader design literature and reviews (in-)built biases. Daalhuizen and Hjartarson focus on five aspects: (i) the method user; (ii) method content; (iii) method selection; (iv) acquisition of new methods; and (v) selection aid. To link theory to practice, the chapter reviews how method selection is aided giving an overview of 20 online design toolkits. Then, building on a taxonomy of thinking errors and biases in cognitive science, the chapter identifies relevant biases in choosing methodological
28 A. Maier et al.


means in engineering system design. Having elaborated on engineering systems designers’ thinking, on designers’ method and tool use, ▶ Chapter 28, “Creating Effective Efforts: Managing Stakeholder Value” reviews stakeholder value management approaches from project management, including project definition, project governance, project delivery, contractual relationships, and project outcome transfer, and reflects on how these approaches might enrich current practices in the design of engineering systems. Romero-Torres and Brunet illustrate the value of projects and respective approaches with reference to standards and practice guides and conclude with a discussion on the influence of stakeholders’ biases. ▶ Chapter 29, “Ethics and Equity-Centred Perspectives in Engineering Systems Design” highlights ethics and equity-centred perspectives as critical for the advancement of engineering systems design. Glover and Hendricks-Sturrup summarise varying ethical considerations within the literature, including distributive justice, procedural justice, safety ethics, privacy and trust, autonomy, and sustainability. The authors then discuss the influence of assessing ethical behaviour at the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of analysis and present five ethical themes in the current engineering systems design literature: integrating ethics and equity-centred perspectives into design, recognising system boundaries, developing augmented system design criteria, managing trade-offs and conflicting values, and educating systems designers. This multilevel approach is illustrated with examples from health. From ethics and equity to ▶ Chapter 30, “Roles and Skills of Engineering Systems Designers”, the next chapter describes and illustrates that engineering systems designers must consider not just the artefact but also its associated services, the ecosystem and supply chains necessary for its creation and operation, the communities where it is produced and operated, its relation to government regulations and policy, its impact on the environment, and its long-term influence on social behaviours. Papalambros reviews the roles and skills of engineering systems designers required, emphasising design- and systems thinking, and explores the organisational and social motivations behind this evolution in thinking, how such skills may get acquired, and discusses the implications for individual designers, building the bridge to Part V of the Handbook.
Part V: Futures of Engineering Systems Design
Part V Futures of Engineering Systems Design, provides guidance to current and future challenges in engineering systems ways of seeing and designing, highlights opportunities that effective engineering systems design will bring, illustrated with case examples in healthcare and transportation infrastructure, and provides avenues for moving forward, from university education to public policy. This part of the Handbook is opened with ▶ Chapter 31, “Educating Engineering Systems Designers: A Systems Design Competences and Skills Matrix” showing evidenced with literature that there has been a gradual change in emphasis in design education, from technical projects, to systems engineering and more recently, the need to tackle complex sociotechnical engineering systems challenges. Consequently, Moultrie
1 Introducing Engineering Systems Design: A New Engineering Perspective. . . 29


proposes a ‘systems design competences and skills’ matrix for engineering systems design to help design students and educators consider the boundaries around an individual design brief and to consider how a series of design briefs combine to deliver a balanced programme of design education. The matrix is illustrated through six case examples from university engineering programmes, each of varying levels of complexity. ▶ Chapter 32, “Engineering Systems Interventions in Practice: Cases from Healthcare and Transport” describes four real-world practice examples of engineering systems design from Denmark, two in healthcare and two in transportation infrastructure: Transforming national healthcare by construction of super hospitals: developing deep emergency response using Artificial Intelligence (AI), decarbonising global shipping in a global system transformation, and prototyping future urban transport systems. Thuesen et al. document findings across the cases in five learning points: engineering systems design, firstly, applies a systems perspective to understand the entanglement of different system elements, their connections, boundaries, and causal effects; secondly, evaluates the value of these systems in the light of current performance, state of play, (future) technological possibilities, and user needs to identify complication and societal business cases for interventions; thirdly, organises a lineage of projects and programmes across time and space for systematised experimentation to explore the solutions space and implementation at different levels in the engineering system; fourthly embeds standardisation and flexibility in the system for maintaining value delivery while embracing future needs and opportunities; and finally, carefully navigates the complex and dynamic stakeholder landscapes, manages, and develops the discourse within and around the systems through user and public engagement to ensure benefit realisation of the intervention.

Abstract
This chapter reviews developments in engineering systems design from antiquity to the present day, noting especially the continual increase in recent years in the sophistication and interconnectedness of engineered artefacts, and development, from the late nineteenth century, of vast networks for energy, communications, and transportation. Large projects required enormous engineering effort from substantial and often distributed teams, while the networks that developed were “partially designed, partially evolved” with their design and configuration influenced by global actors. These engineering developments led to the need for new tools, methods, and approaches to support engineers in their work, and these are reviewed, beginning with the introduction of drawings – measured plans – and developing through design methods to systems engineering and project management in the latter part of the twentieth century. Concurrently, there was the emergence in the scientific community of the notion of a system,

which led to new scientific studies, from systems analysis and cybernetics to network science and soft systems methodology. These various strands have come together at the beginning of the twenty-first century to a multifaceted present state, in which many different lines of research and practice may be brought to bear on the engineering systems design challenges of the century, of complex systems of systems, and their interaction with an increasingly overburdened natural world.

Introduction
While one might regard the notion of engineering systems as a recent development, if we consider the ways that important functions in society, such as the supply of water, food, energy, and shelter, are typically fulfilled by artefacts with significant interwoven technological and social complexity (de Weck et al. 2011), then such systems have existed since antiquity. Through history, these will have been amongst the most highly organised and knowledge-intensive aspects of the societies that created them. Consider, for example, the organisation, knowledge, and skills required for the Romans to build the concrete artificial harbour at Caesarea (Brandon et al. 2014) or their network of roads or aqueducts. Or consider the organisation, knowledge, and skills required in the nineteenth century to build continent-wide communication and railway networks, requiring their engineers to design whole systems, not just individual artefacts like locomotives. These posed enormous challenges to their contemporary societies, just as the design, operation, and evolution of the interlinked networks that pervade our lives today are amongst the greatest challenges of our age. The practice of considering engineering in systems terms is however a more recent one that emerged from the great engineering developments of the end of the nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century. Examples are the immense networks for communications and the provision of electricity and ever-more complicated engineering hardware, particularly for flight, power generation, and military purposes. It also developed from a more general appearance in the twentieth century of “systems” ideas as a way of viewing the natural and artificial world. From these, “systems thinking” tools and methods were developed, specifically motivated by a systems viewpoint, and “systems engineering” arrived as a discipline. This chapter will explore the interwoven history of engineering, of engineering tools and methods and disciplines, and of wider systems ideas that is behind today’s understanding of engineering systems design. This chapter will start with a very broad overview of those engineering developments from antiquity in which, in retrospect, the concept of systems may be seen,

before moving onto the emergence, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of artefacts of significant engineering sophistication, especially, for example, military fortifications and naval vessels (McGee 1999). The exponential growth of engineered networks (railways, electrical, telegraphy) in the nineteenth century (Hughes 1993), together with the appearance of very large projects to deliver highly complex artefacts (supersonic aircraft, the Manhattan and Polaris projects, the Apollo moon landings), will then be presented as a driving force in the emergence of systems ideas in engineering. The following section will then explore how, over a similar timescale, tools and methods emerged to support the activities of engineering design, especially, for example, in the emergence of formal approaches to engineering drawing in naval architecture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to allow “the application of mathematical and physical theory in design, long before the modern era” (McGee 1999). It will be argued that similar pressures led in the twentieth century to developments such as computer-aided design and manufacture and the emergence of systems engineering “coordinating the functions of constituent components and subsystems and overseeing the engineering efforts of those who developed them” (Sato 2005). From this background, the key ideas of systems engineering will be presented, including such issues as systems architecture, modelling and simulation, systems analysis, and so on. Concurrently with the developments in engineering, developments in the sciences were leading to the emergence in the scientific community of the notion of a system as a “generalisation of ideas about organisms which were developed within biology in the first half of the twentieth century” (Checkland 1999). The concept of a system became useful as an explanatory device in a variety of scientific endeavours. In the next section, the origins of a number of core systems ideas – such as adaptive wholes, emergent properties, layered structures, and processes of communication and of control – will be presented, together with a discussion of such issues as cybernetics, complexity, and network science and the distinction between hard systems and soft systems. By the latter part of the twentieth century, systems engineering approaches to the design and delivery of “one-time, large projects with a definite start and end, where a new system is to be designed and created to meet customer needs” (Sato 2005), were mature and well-described. They were, however, still the subject of significant research, as was the question of how we understand systems that are “partially designed, partially evolved” (e.g., De Weck et al. 2011). In particular, we will consider complex “systems of systems” in today’s interconnected networks in which engineering challenges are intimately mixed with social, institutional, political, and environmental issues and in which design of policy and intervention can be as important as design of the physical elements of the system. In the final sections of the chapter, these developments will be broadly described, together with the rapidly developing use of systems approaches to understand the behaviour of designed artefacts embedded in our cultural and socio-economic systems and their interaction with the sociopolitical and natural world.

Origins
De Weck et al. call engineering systems “the systems that fulfil important functions in society [. . .] characterized by high levels of interwoven technological and social complexity” (de Weck et al. 2011). Arguably, the approaches that the Romans used for transportation and water supply conform to that definition. Consider the social organisation necessary to gather the materials needed to construct many kilometres of roads or aqueducts (Davies 1998) or the technical understanding and energy needed to produce the vast quantities of concrete, able to set underwater, used for the artificial harbour at Caesarea in the Eastern Mediterranean (Oleson 1988). There was evident “interwoven technological and social complexity” needed for the provision of transportation and water, although of course clearly distinguished from what pertains today by the scale of the interactions and the numbers of actors and technologies involved. After the fall of the Roman empire, it was some centuries before engineering in Europe re-emerged at a similar scale, first perhaps in the great palaces and cathedrals of the medieval age and then by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in naval shipbuilding and military fortifications that were amongst the most complicated activities undertaken at the time. These required considerable investment in materials, construction facilities, and trained labour and coordination of their interaction. A significant part of seventeenth century Copenhagen, for example, was devoted to the construction of naval vessels, and the oak tree, source of timber for ships, was of very great socio-technical importance at the time (Eliasson and Nilsson 2002). Ships were also a key technology for the transportation networks of the time. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw considerable growth in shipping routes and networks and in ports for the loading and unloading of ships. By the end of the eighteenth century, London had many kilometres of wharves such that by the early nineteenth century dedicated docks had to be built. It was in this century that what became the modern engineered networks emerged, with metaled roads, country- and continent-wide railway networks, sewers and water supply, and then telegraph and electrical networks. The century also saw the increasing linking together of these telegraph networks being built alongside railways and being used to communicate between signalling staff and then electrical power being used for rail vehicles and trams. The social-technical effort required to achieve all of these – the banking systems, construction and manufacturing enterprises, schools, and then research and training institutions – was considerable (Hughes 1993). The century also saw the founding of institutions of engineering education and the beginning of a number of engineering professional groups. The main technical evolution of the core networked systems was undertaken by many groups, often competing on an international basis. Nevertheless, engineering very much involved “a lot of material connected together by a little knowledge”, and significant technical leaps were still very often made by individuals (Hughes 1993; Little 2000). In the twentieth century, the effort involved in the development of engineering artefacts expanded exponentially, especially during and after the Second
36 C. McMahon


World War. In 1940, the engineering effort required for development of a fighter aircraft was 17,000 hours. By 1955 it was 1.4 million hours (Johnson 1997). The Manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb and then projects to develop Polaris missiles and nuclear submarines, large radar systems, civilian nuclear reactors, and the Apollo spacecraft required the coordination of very large, distributed teams and were often carried out under conditions of considerable initial uncertainty. By the end of the century, the design of single artefacts with enormous numbers of interconnected parts – ten million transistors in a single integrated circuit, many million discrete parts in a commercial aircraft – was routine. These were the one-time, large projects with a definite start and end described by Sato (2005). It is possible to identify the individual actors that come together to design and build an aircraft or an integrated circuit. If, however, we examine how our engineering networks have evolved, this becomes an impossible task. Long distance telephone, radio, television, the Internet, mobile telephony, and satellite communications were added to the relatively simple telecommunications networks of the end of the nineteenth century and rapidly became ubiquitous. There was also an explosion of growth in electrical and transportation networks, reaching billions of consumers by the end of the twentieth century. These networks were, and are, “partially designed, partially evolved” (de Weck et al. 2011), built on foundational rules and principles – standards and protocols – within the framework of which diverse actors are free to propose developments. De Weck et al. describe this progression over the past century or so as developing from the “epoch of artefacts and inventions” through the “epoch of complex systems” in the middle of the last century to the “epoch of engineered systems” today. We can also summarise these developments in terms of an increase in numbers in multiple dimensions:
• The number of different physical principles exploited by the technologies embedded in our artefacts – from elastic resistance of materials through combustion and electron flows to radio waves. • The number of specialists needed in those physical principles – from civil and mechanical to electrical and communications engineers. • The number of parts involved in artefacts from simple boats and buildings to complicated aircraft and integrated circuits; the number of nodes and connections in networks – from early electrical networks powering a few hundred light bulbs to the Internet with billions of nodes. • The number of people and organisations involved in the design and manufacture of the artificial world. • The length of time over which they interact.
These numbers, and the interactions that they lead to – with each other and with the natural world – mean that we have a great need of approaches to help us deal with the consequent challenging complexity.

Approaches to Support the Engineer
Alongside the development and application of engineering technologies have come the development and application of approaches – such as tools, methods, systems of organisation – to assist engineers and other actors in the design and implementation of the technologies. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, commonly known as Vitruvius, documented Roman practices in architecture and construction in the first century BC in his multivolume work entitled De architectura (McEwen 2003), but it was with the complicated military artefacts of the renaissance – especially fortifications and naval vessels – that some of our modern engineering tools began to emerge. From those beginnings, the last two centuries have seen continual development, often highly influenced by the cultural context in which it has taken place. In (McGee 1999), David McGee explores the development of the use of formal engineering drawings – “measured plans” in naval architecture in seventeenth century Britain. He notes that at that time British naval dockyards were the largest industrial organisation in the world and remained so throughout the industrial revolution that followed. McGee builds on J. Christopher Jones’s argument that the development of design based on drawings during the Renaissance marked a shift from “craftsmanship to draftsmanship” because of “the advantages provided by drawings with respect to both construction and innovation” (McGee 1999). McGee notes that Jones argued that drawing permitted tentative design decisions to be stored allowing the design of more complex artefacts by enabling designers to deal with an otherwise “unmanageable, and unimaginable, degree of complexity” (Jones 1992, quoted by McGee). He argues that such measured plans were used predominantly as an architectural tool and because of the need to control production costs. The use of measured plans was central to an architectural tradition to control construction, while for the exploration of ideas and mechanical arrangements, designers still used “rough, single-view, back-of-the-envelope style sketches”. McGee also argues that “neither levels of complexity nor different kinds of constraints drive the adoption and development of new design methods, but rather different levels of cost do”. This in turn “yields a narrative in which similar human beings struggle with different contexts of risk”. McGee notes also that early hopes to enlist a higher level of scientific contribution to the design process were relatively unsuccessful. Over the following centuries, measured plans – engineering drawings – became firmly embedded in engineering practice. The formal basis of descriptive geometry was established by Gaspard Monge at the beginning of the nineteenth century (Monge 1811), and, during that century, detail drawings came to be used, together with tolerance dimensions, as a means of achieving interchangeability of parts, especially in arms manufacture. During the century, they also became a key driver of the US system of manufacturing, described by Brown (2000) as an example of the importance of social institutions in shaping technical activities. Comparing US and British engineering practice from the mid-nineteenth century, Brown relates how American engineers “devoted themselves to standardising design elements and rationalising production”, “subdividing work through working drawings and other
38 C. McMahon


industrial engineering measures”, so driving down the price of their products. British engineers, by contrast, often pursued a different course, focusing on design creativity and the generation of customised products, realised through the strong craft skills of their production workers (Brown 2000) (although it should be noted that British engineers were early users of mass production through Brunel’s pioneering system for the production of rigging blocks for the Royal Navy installed at Portsmouth in 1805 (Cooper 1984)). At this time, standardisation also emerged as a very important issue in the development of networks. In the early days of railway operation, different track gauges were often used by different companies. Interoperability soon made it necessary for national and then international standards to be adopted, not only for the separation of the tracks but also for the loading gauge limiting vehicle sizes (Puffert 2009). The same process would be seen in the development of electrical power with initial competition between AC and DC systems and many different voltages and frequencies used in electrical power systems. In telegraphy, many protocols (and physical arrangements) for message transmission were used before development was allowed to thrive by engineers settling on standard voltages and systems such as Morse code becoming widely used (although differences in practice between the USA, British Empire, and continental Europe persisted for many years). By today, standardisation – whether by regulation or de facto choice of the market has developed as an underpinning foundation of our digital age (Russell 2014). Social and political institutions were again very important in the development of electrical power networks, as described by Hughes in his celebrated work (1993). Hughes emphasises that a systems lens should be used to consider the development of these networks and describes the profound influence of political and social factors in such systems by comparing developments in the USA, UK, France, and Germany. For example, the initial legal framework for development established in the UK became a significant constraint on progress. Hughes also provides great insight into the characteristics of the processes of invention and development that pertained at the time, including the interplay between inventors and businessmen and the development of research and manufacturing capabilities. He describes technical progress using the military metaphor of “reverse salients”, where, having made progress on other fronts, inventors, engineers, and scientists concentrate their efforts on the critical, difficult problems that stand in the way of development. He notes that development of the technologies was inextricably linked with the development of “massive, extensive, vertically integrated production systems”, bringing together finance, production, and operations. Once such systems were established, and the technical knowledge had matured, the technology acquired a “technological momentum” of its own (Hughes, op cit. and Little, op cit.), but the social, institutional, and political continued to have enormous significance in determining the direction of engineering systems development and in guiding the design of policy and regulation. De Weck et al. describe the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth as the epoch of artefacts and inventors, but it was also the time at which business-based research and development laboratories began to be established (de Weck et al. op cit). Edison’s establishment of his research lab at Menlo Park in
2 History of Engineering Systems Design Research and Practice 39


1876 was one of his major innovations, and Thomson used his model room at the Thomson-Houston company. However, it was the early years of the twentieth century that development really took off, with the establishment of research labs in General Electric, AT&T, and Eastman Kodak, and a profound expansion in scientific research at US universities (Carlson 2013). Following the First World War, the number of research labs grew markedly as companies tried to manage the risks involved in new developments – individual inventors were seen as too unpredictable – and, by 1940, 2000 firms employed over 7000 people in such departments. In part they tackled the critical “reverse salient” challenges that Hughes has described – leading, for example, to the development of feedback control and the transistor by Bell Labs (formed from the 1925 merger of AT&T R&D and Western Electric) – but they also provided important scientific support services to firms. Carlson notes, however, that despite large investment in such R&D labs, blockbuster innovations such as the integrated circuit and personal computer came from small start-up companies, although these were often dependent on military funding and on the large labs for information and personnel. We have noted in the previous section that by the middle of the twentieth century, and especially during and after the Second World War, engineering development often required the coordination of large, interdisciplinary teams, sometimes working at the very limits of scientific and engineering knowledge. As noted by Johnson, “technological systems had grown too complex for traditional methods of management and development. Existing organisations could not easily assimilate and integrate technologies such as nuclear weapons, radar, and rocket propulsion” (Johnson 1997). Johnson notes that the response was again very influenced by social and cultural factors, in this case dependent on the communities from which the new approaches emerged. Mathematicians developed the new approaches of applied mathematics in operations research, and management specialists developed the techniques and discipline of project management, while engineers, explicitly using the term “systems”, developed systems engineering. In Johnson’s words, “scientists used their mathematical prowess to analyse current or future operational systems. They did not build these systems; consequently their perception of the problem was analytical. By contrast, engineers designed and developed systems to specifications determined by others. Engineers in industry saw systems engineering as a systematic design process, consistent with their daily involvement with large projects. Managers made decisions about whether to build systems and controlled their development and use. They organised new communication and control procedures around the technical system. Functional hierarchies gave way to more flexible ‘team’ and ‘matrix’ forms organised around the end product”, and later “the military and the aerospace industry found [these approaches] useful [and] they became the most influential and practical applications of “the systems approach”, the core of much of the American R&D system of the 1960s”. From these early beginnings, systems engineering has developed in a number of directions. In 1946 the US Air Force established a nonprofit think tank called the Rand Corporation in the Douglas Aircraft Company. In 1948 it was spun out as an independent corporation. It was highly influential in the development of systems

approaches, especially systems analysis, a set of techniques that became core to systems engineering and have been developed through the structured analysis methods of the 1980s to today’s modelling languages and model-based system engineering (MBSE) approaches (Dickerson and Mavris 2013). However, by the 1980s, it was recognised that systems engineering did not give sufficient attention to the up-front part of the process and that this was a source of failure in the design and development of many systems. What was missing was a focus on the overall architecture of the system, the coordination of the design across architectural boundaries, and the translation of architectures into modules and organisational structures. This led to interest in systems architecture, a key aspect of design planning and negotiation, drawing on research in software architecture that was also emerging as a significant area of inquiry at that time (Grinter 1999). At the end of the previous section, it was suggested that engineers needed approaches that would help them deal with the increasing complexity of the engineered world. It is clear that many of the developments that have taken place have been to help deal with complexity, whether, for example, in terms of the number of parts and their interactions or in terms of the number of disciplines and actors involved in engineering processes. But it is also clear that we need to look more closely at the drivers of the development of such approaches and the constraints surrounding the development. The need to manage cost and risk – commercial and technical – has been an important consideration through the centuries, as has the social, political, and cultural environment in which developments have taken place. It is also clear that we cannot isolate the development of engineering systems from the more general systems developments – financial, political, industrial, and cultural – that have taken place in our societies. In many ways the development of systems engineering approaches in the second half of the last century mirrored interest in the development of approaches to support engineering design more widely, with their emphasis, inter alia, on process (Wynn and Clarkson 2018; Piccolo et al. 2019), on architecture (Jiao et al. 2007), on modelling (Andreasen 1994), and on organisation and management of the actors involved (Badke-Schaub and Frankenberger 1999). During this period, a great deal of interaction has developed between the researchers and practitioners in the two communities and between them and other communities, for example, in mathematics and in the management and life sciences. In the next section, we will consider developments in systems thinking more generally and the application of systems design ideas in domains beyond engineering.
The Wider Development of Systems Thinking
Over the period in which the notion of systems has come to dominate the way we view engineering, systems thinking has been more and more influential in the way that many aspects of the world are viewed. As noted in the Introduction, Checkland (1999) considers that systems ideas emerged as a “generalisation of ideas about organisms which were developed within biology in the first half of the twentieth
2 History of Engineering Systems Design Research and Practice 41


century”. He attributes the emergence of the systems movement to organismic biologists and to the notion that “ideas about organisms could be extended to complex wholes of any kind”. In other words, the concept of a system became useful as a general explanatory device for some sorts of entities. In (Checkland 1999), Checkland is discussing the role of systems thinking in management information systems. His advice is relevant to the design of engineered systems more generally. He makes a number of cautionary points, stressing that that general systems theory cannot necessarily immediately help in the design of systems – there is no simple link – but that systems thinking is very relevant and can illuminate problems. Part of the issue, he says, is language: “there are great difficulties in an ill-formed and conceptually confused field like management . . . which stem from the fact that there is no language available for serious discussion which is separate from everyday language [. . .] terms are fuzzy as a result of their unreflective use in everyday chat” (Checkland 1999, p. 46). This is surely an issue that we see concerning the use of language in design and engineering systems more generally. Checkland notes that we talk casually in many domains about so-called systems “which in real life only occasionally and partially actually meet the requirement of the notion ‘system’ [. . .] an abstract concept of a [. . .] complex whole entity of a particular kind” (Checkland 1999, p. 46) (although Checkland does recognise that there are clear “designed physical systems” that engineers design and construct). Having noted these caveats about the use of language and direct relevance of systems theory to engineering, let us return to the scientific origins. As noted, organismic biologists focused on the organism as a unit of analysis in biology. This was driven by the issue of vitalism in living things, which were clearly more than the sum of their parts. Holistic thinking in biology led, for example, to the development of ideas about metabolism and self-reproduction. The systems movement more generally was founded by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, one of the organismic biologists, who argued, starting in the 1940s, that these “systems” ideas about organisms could be extended to complex wholes of any kind, emphasising holism over reductionism, organism over mechanism (Checkland 1999; Von Bertalanffy 1969). In 1954, a Society for the Advancement of General Systems Theory was proposed under the initiative of von Bertalanffy together with colleagues from physiology, economics, mathematics, and the behavioural sciences. It was established in 1955 as the Society for General Systems Research (now the International Society for the Systems Sciences (https://www.myisss.org/)). Checkland emphasises that it was systems thinking that is useful, rather than systems theory per se, suggesting that “systems thinking has emerged as a metadiscipline and as a meta-language which can be used to talk about the subject matter of many fields”. The role of systems thinking as a meta-subject is seen, for example, in the incorporation of cybernetics – the use of communication and feedback systems in the general (meta-level) science of “communication and control in man and machine” introduced in 1948 by Wiener – as a subset of systems thinking (Wiener 1948). At this point, it is perhaps worth summarising Checkland’s proposal of the key ideas of systems thinking, which are:
42 C. McMahon


• The central idea is that of an entity which can adapt and survive in a changing environment – the adaptive whole (and, as an aside, we can perhaps see immediately that this is challenging in engineering; a large passenger aircraft, e.g., although extremely complicated, does not meet this notion of an adaptive whole). • The entity must have properties as a single entity – emergent properties – that are more than the sum of the parts. • Wholes having emergent properties may have smaller wholes with their own emergent properties – there is a layered structure (Checkland uses the example of a university having emergent properties and in turn comprising departments with their own emergent properties). • If entities are to survive, they must have ways of finding out about and responding to their environments – they must have processes of communication and control.
Checkland notes the success of systems ideas in interpreting the natural world and in designed entities, especially when there could be carefully designed objectives, but he remarks also about the struggle that there was initially when trying to apply systems concepts in human affairs, in part because of the difficulty in defining objectives precisely. But this was often what made the application domain problematic in the first place! This was addressed by introducing the concepts of purposeful action and modelling systems, based on a declared worldview, to help structure the problem under study. Such an approach became known as the soft systems methodology (SSM) to distinguish it from the hard systems of systems engineering, and which Checkland describes as “learning systems, a system of enquiry, one which happens to make use of models of activity systems”. Worldview, problem structuring, purposeful action, and system modelling are today core approaches in systems thinking (Blockley and Godfrey 2017). Emergence is a general term in systems but applied particularly during the process of self-organisation in complex systems, and, in this regard, it is a key concept in the study of organisational complexity. Goldstein (1999) describes emergent phenomena in complex systems as “neither predictable from, deducible from, nor reducible to the parts alone”, noting that “conceptual constructs resembling emergence can be found in western thought since the time of the ancient Greeks”; he traces development of the term from its use in the nineteenth century to describe results of certain chemical reactions and then in the 1920s to form the backbone of emergent evolutionism. He also notes that its current use in complexity theory has its roots in the study of dynamics of systems in the physical sciences and mathematics going back to the Second World War. Emergence requires systems with at least the characteristics of non-linearity, self-organisation, beyond-equilibrium behaviour (e.g., amplification of random events in far-from-equilibrium conditions), and attractors (e.g., limit states and fixed points) which drive behaviour. Goldstein describes this notion of emergence as being important in a number of systems domains (and ubiquitous in organisations), including complex adaptive systems theory, non-linear dynamical systems, far-from equilibrium thermodynamics, and synergetics (Buckminster Fuller 1975) (related to non-equilibrium thermodynamics and exploring self-organisation of patterns and structures in open systems).
2 History of Engineering Systems Design Research and Practice 43


An important driver behind the search for problem-structuring methods is the messiness of many complex problems, especially where social aspects are significant. There is a fundamental indeterminacy in such problems, and all but the most trivial issues may fall into this class. Rittel described these as “wicked problems”, a “class of social system problems which are ill-formulated, where information is confusing, where there are many clients and decision-makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing” (Churchman 1967). Wicked problems are often symptoms of other, higher-level problems and have no definitive formulation, although every formulation attempted corresponds to a solution, which can be only good or bad, although there can be no definitive test of this (Buchanan 1992). However, while the term “wicked” is often used in design and systems thinking, in Buchanan’s view, it is a description of the social reality of such approaches rather than the basis of a well-founded theory of design. In the world of complex, indeterminant, wicked problems, the search has been for “sense-making” devices that can help in explaining and guiding courses of action. Blockley and Godfrey, in their book on systems approaches for rethinking infrastructure (2017), list many of the techniques that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century including the Analytic Hierarchy Process, balanced scorecard, causal loop diagrams and modelling, system dynamics, root definition (CATWOE), stakeholder analysis, SWOT analysis, use case analysis, N2 mapping, mind maps, PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental) analysis, and others. They note that a particularly useful framework for such sensemaking is Cynefin, devised by Snowden at IBM in 1999, in which decision-making contexts were divided into five categories: simple, complicated, complex, chaotic, and disordered. Blockley and Godfrey suggest that complex corresponds to wicked and/or messy and involves high interconnectivities and highly emergent uncertainties. Complicated contexts are also highly interconnected but well-understood at different levels, while simple contexts, which they call “tame”, are linear, manageable, and controllable. They group chaotic and disordered, using the descriptive term “utter confusion”. A particularly important approach to the understanding of the dynamic behaviour of systems is system dynamic modelling, originally devised in the 1950s at MIT by Forrester (2007) and which considers dynamic systems in terms of “stocks” (quantities measured at a particular point and time), “flows” (measured over a period of time and analogous to rates of change), “sources” and “sinks” from which flows originate and through which they exit, and cause-and-effect feedback loops, also known as “causal loops”. Forrester’s research team implemented his ideas in executable computer models that were initially applied to management and then urban planning issues but perhaps had their most celebrated application in the Club of Rome’s study of the demands being placed on the world’s carrying capacity, which resulted in the book Limits to Growth, published in 1972 (Meadows et al. 1972). A system dynamics model is an example of a network of nodes (in this case, stocks, sources, and sinks) joined by links or edges (flows). We have seen that in technology and society, networks may be found everywhere – for electricity and
44 C. McMahon


communications and for transportation, between people and organisations, and so on. In recent years, the explosion of growth in communications networks, especially the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW), has sparked great interest in network science. This discipline studies the characteristics of such networks under different configurations, building on earlier work, for example, in graph theory and sociograms. Through such study we might understand, for example, what might make the WWW robust or susceptible to attack or how viruses might spread in human populations or amongst computers. Barabási (2002) explains how, for many years, networks were viewed as being random in their interconnections. However, he and colleagues at the University of Notre Dame, studying the topology of part of the World Wide Web, came up with the notion that there are networks in which some nodes (called “hubs”) have many more connections than others and that the number of links connecting nodes was described by a power-law. This configuration, which came to be called “scale-free networks”, may be seen in a number of other networks, including citation networks, social networks, air transportation route patterns, and so on. While the merits of the scale-free model are the subject of debate, it and related work led to a blossoming of studies on network characteristics in recent years. These include such topics as dynamic network analysis, centrality measures (the relative importance of nodes and edges in a network), and pandemic analysis. Perhaps the most widely used result of such studies is the PageRank mechanism used by Google to rank web pages in their search engine results (Page et al. 1999).
To the Present Day
So, in summary, what can we say about engineering systems design, research, and practice at this point early in the twenty-first century? We must first acknowledge Checkland’s caveat regarding the term “system” in everyday usage. There is an enormous variety of applications and potential interpretations of the term, and it is therefore perhaps not surprising that there are multiple threads running through the descriptions of the previous sections. Ask any engineer and he or she will most likely give a good definition of a system and examples of where we can see systems in engineering. Ask about the design approaches that these systems require or whether the examples are complicated or complex, and we might have a debate that lasts all day! Nevertheless, it is possible to identify a number of clear threads running through the historical development that has been described. The first thread is that engineers develop approaches, tools, and methods for a variety of reasons. They seek help in dealing with complexity and intricacy. They seek help with model building and communication. They use them to predict performance and to allow design to take account of many facets (the “ilities” (de Weck et al. 2011) reliability, manufacturability, maintainability, sustainability, and so on). They allow science to be applied and, especially, to assist in the control of cost and risk. For many of these applications, taking a systems view and using the tools of systems science are especially important in view of the scale, intricacy, and
2 History of Engineering Systems Design Research and Practice 45


interconnectedness of today’s artefacts, whether we explicitly use the term “system” or not. The second thread is that the particular discipline of systems engineering arose in the middle of the twentieth century, to deal with the complicated, multi-technology artefacts of that time. It grew alongside project engineering and operations research and has identifiable professional groups (e.g., the International Council of Systems Engineering, INCOSE); a mature set of techniques, many embedded in standards (especially concerning systems engineering processes (ISO/IEC 15288)); and an academic infrastructure of courses, departments, and research literature. But although systems engineering practices are applied in many branches of engineering, they are most firmly embedded in aerospace, computing, and defence. Voices in the systems engineering community recognise that systems ideas are applied widely in engineering without the formal term “systems engineering” necessarily being used and even that systems engineering has somewhat of an identity crisis (Emes et al. 2005). The third thread is that systems ideas and systems thinking developed strongly in the last century, with applications across a range of disciplines and with multiple facets – systems analysis, sense-making and problem-structuring tools and methods, systems dynamics, cybernetics, network science, and more. With origins in the biological sciences, the approaches found a natural application in engineering but also growing applications in business, organisation, and social contexts, which became classed by some as “soft systems”, to distinguish from the “hard systems” of engineering. Recognising that engineered systems are produced and operated by human actors, this distinction is perhaps seen less strongly today. Systems approaches are becoming embedded in many aspects of human endeavours, from project, program, and portfolio management (Oehmen et al. 2015) to infrastructure provision (Blockley and Godfrey 2017) to healthcare (Clarkson 2018). What was the focus of the engineering design research community at that time? At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Andreasen, reflecting on the International Conferences on Engineering Design (ICED), identified four key themes (Andreasen 2001) which have clear parallels with those that we have met in the systems community. The first was a large body of work seeking to explore what constituted design science: what was the scientific basis for the subject and what were the appropriate research methodologies to be used in its study? The second reflected a development from a concentration on mechanical design, especially machine design, to a wider emphasis on product development. There was in particular a developing interest in “design for X” (DfX), where “X” described life cycle properties of the designed artefact that included especially manufacturability and assemblability but also issues related to environmental performance and to design for the whole life cycle. The X here corresponds largely with the “ilities” that we have met. This group also contained papers on teamwork, on the human aspects of design – including collaboration and creativity. The third large group of papers reflected the strong interest at the time in computer-aided design (CAD) but also showed developing emphasis on wider application of information technologies in many aspects of design from automated synthesis to information and knowledge
46 C. McMahon


management and many aspects of modelling. Andreasen named a fourth and final body of work “delimitations of ICED”, describing the papers published in this group as broadening out from the engineering focus to a wider interest in innovation more generally. The emphasis on product development reflected very strongly the competitive industrial culture of the time. Design for X – design for manufacture in particular – was perhaps a response to the rapidly escalating labour costs of the 1970s and the prowess that the Japanese had shown in manufacturing productivity but also to the increasing awareness of environmental issues. The emphasis on information technology was a natural product of the rapidly developing computing technologies and in particular the transition to CAD in industry which was taking place very strongly at the time. Which brings us to the present day and to the term “engineering systems” that has been used to describe the epoch in which the network technologies of the twentieth century – including communications, energy, and transportation – are increasingly integrated and interdependent but also ever-changing as more and more actors add more and more elements to the networks. Any part of any network will have been designed, but there has not necessarily been any design of the networks as a whole, only of the rules and principles on which they operate (or, at the very least, design has been distributed amongst many actors). They are, as noted, partially designed, partially evolved, and furthermore are often “systems of systems”. These are multiple systems that interact but that can and do operate independently of each other (Maier 1998, quoted by de Weck). Electrical and communication systems are classic examples of such systems, but global manufacturing systems and the associated logistics and supply chains are further fine examples (Myerson 2012). In addition to strong engineering development such as growing capability in modelling and simulation (e.g., Fujimoto et al. 2017), the twenty-first century has also seen a growing emphasis on social and socio-technical aspects of systems (see, e.g., (Kroes et al. 2006) and (De Bruijn and Herder 2009)), in which human agents and social institutions are considered as integral parts of systems. A socio-technical systems approach has been applied to the design of engineered systems such as infrastructure and transportation systems (Ottens et al. 2006), while more widely it has been applied to innovation studies by considering sectors (e.g., regional, groups of firms) in systems terms (Geels 2004). Issues that have been studied include complex systems governance (Jaradat 2015), the achievement of social value (Browning and Honour 2008), and the philosophical underpinnings of the topic (Bauer and Herder 2009). In addition, new academic and professional groupings have emerged with interest in engineering systems design and research, including the Council of Engineering Systems Universities (CESUN, cesun.org), established in 2004 by universities offering educational and research programs in engineering systems, reflecting the developing importance of engineering systems research and teaching in universities around the world. In the present day, it is also clear that the scale of the complex, interlinked engineered networks that support our current lifestyles is challenging for other reasons: the rates at which we extract materials from natural sources and the rates at which we cast waste materials into global sinks – whether plastics, CO2, oxides of
2 History of Engineering Systems Design Research and Practice 47


nitrogen, or other pollutants – are widely believed to be beyond the capacity of our planet to support (Steffen et al. 2015). Measured behaviours are showing good agreement with the system dynamics models of the Club of Rome (Bardi 2011). Achieving a sustainable existence for more than 7 billion inhabitants is arguably the most complex, wicked problem that we have faced. We can design approaches which we hope will be less damaging, but the test of these is likely to be what happens as we try to scale up their adoption – how will they interact with other artefacts, what will the political and social consequences be, and what will be their impacts on the natural world? These are all clearly systems issues and merit a strongly systemsoriented approach in tackling them. Although Williams et al. report that systemic ideas are not yet mainstream in management science literature, the core systems ideas of interconnections, feedbacks, adaptive capacity, emergence, and selforganisation figure strongly in systems thinking for sustainability research (Williams et al. 2017). Geels (2002) suggests that a similar effort to that devoted to the emergence of large technical systems, as described by Hughes and others, will need to be devoted to the characteristics and processes of transitioning from our present technical systems to new less environmentally damaging ones. In these circumstances, it is very important to realise that, in the context of engineering systems design, especially of complex interlinked networks, designing happens most likely never from scratch: new design work will add to, modify, or partially replace elements – technical and non-technical – of existing systems, and must be done with all the past work on those systems in the background. Effectively we are designing interventions, and such interventions must be based on an understanding of the political and social context as well as the technical. In this regard, there are many possibilities for the way such interventions can be achieved – by new technologies, certainly, but also by new or modified standards and regulations, by political and social action, and by the creation of new or adaptation of existing societal institutions. Any change that is made will also potentially impact all of the other systems that interact with the system in which the intervention is made.
Conclusions
From antiquity, many aspects of the engineered world have been systems, but since the end of the nineteenth century, the sophistication of major artefacts, and the number, scale, and interconnectedness of the networks that support human activity, has led to the need for new approaches to the design and operation of the artificial world. These new approaches have arisen from the demands of the sheer complexity of engineering but in particular from the need to control cost and risk and to enable the efforts of an enormous number of stakeholders to be brought to bear. The new approaches have been developed in different social and political contexts, in turn comprising systems of finance, political organisation, and the like. These contexts have had a large influence on the emergence of engineering systems design research and practice. In the twentieth century, a specific discipline of “systems engineering” emerged, focused on the design and implementation of technological systems “too complex for traditional methods of management and development”. In parallel with this

development was the growth of systems thinking in a variety of domains, new systems sciences, and new understandings and research movements in design. The end of the twentieth century saw a veritable melting pot of ideas and movements, all influencing and cross-fertilising each other. Engineering systems now encompasses the realisation of technologically sophisticated artefacts such as aircraft or computers and their embedding in complex operational socio-technical systems involving huge infrastructure and enabled by ubiquitous information technology. Moreover, it encompasses the realisation of the highly interconnected networks of energy, transportation, and communications that are partially designed, partially evolved, while taking intense cognisance of the interactions between the engineered world, social and political systems, and the natural world. Engineering systems design approaches have, in this context, increasingly emphasised social and socio-technical issues and the creation of value. The success of engineering systems design approaches may be seen all around us, in the remarkable performance of the artefacts that have been created. And yet there is increasing disquiet amongst some observers. These systems depend on finite resources, and their operation threatens the stability of the climate and the ability of land and water resources to cope. It has been suggested that increasing systems complexity comes at a potential cost in terms of resilience and diminishing returns (Tainter 1988). Understanding what should be done to try to address these issues demands a deep understanding of the interaction between engineering systems, human systems and behaviours, and natural systems and may be the greatest challenge yet for engineering systems design research and practice.

Abstract
Engineering systems are socio-technical systems that provide solutions to fundamental economic and societal challenges. Such systems are complex in both technical and human terms. Engineering systems evolve over time, and uncertainty over time plays a decisive role. Perspectives on design, design theories, and design processes can be used to guide and support designers of engineering systems. This chapter provides an introduction to several wellestablished perspectives on design, such as design as participatory activity, design as unique mode of thinking, and more. In the same way design theories are introduced, exemplified by C-K theory, axiomatic design, domain theory, and others; and an introduction to well-known processes, including stage-based, agile, and set-based models and many more, is provided. It is explained how each of the discussed approaches offers valuable insights that help to address different aspects of complex systems design. The evolution of the approaches reflects the evolving recognition of users and context when designing engineering systems.

Introduction
We live in a world in which the results of technology advancements are evident in our everyday lives. Human-made products and systems have a profound impact on how we live our lives, many of which have been realised by engineers doing design. Historically, engineering designers have focused on designing products that fulfil particular functions and perform in a particular way and that at the same time can be manufactured cost-effectively (see, e.g., Cross 2021; Pahl et al. 2007; Ullman 1992). However, products are increasingly seen as parts of larger systems, such that they cannot be designed in isolation. Designing these engineering systems involves consideration of how they behave and interact with users, with other products, and with society at large. Engineering design views engineering systems mainly from the perspective of the evolving product, with due consideration to its systemic context. Consideration of the socio-technical interactions and impact now needs to be an integral part of the design process of what is called an engineering system (De Weck et al. 2011). To design the engineering system in this wider context, design teams need to combine a broad range of skills and knowledge from within engineering disciplines as well as social, emotional, and cognitive skills and alongside economic and business skills and knowledge (see, e.g., Subrahmanian et al. 2020). The important role of design to address our societal and climate level challenges is now emphasised (Design Council 2021).

Over the years, engineering designers and design researchers have approached design from a number of perspectives, which provide complementary insights into different aspects of the design problem and have developed a number of theories that offer an abstract and generic view on design. They have also developed process models that describe both how design is done and how it should be done. This chapter discusses some well-established design perspectives, theories, and processes and their application to the design of engineering systems. A good example of an engineering system, which we discuss throughout the chapter and we have also worked on, is an aircraft and its role as part of a transport solution. A century ago, the main design problem was how to master the flight physics of the aircraft itself (Vincenti 1990), ensuring that propulsive power was sufficient and that structural integrity was ensured. Today, the design challenge in air transport is to design and deliver a sustainable, zero-carbon transport solution within a few decades (see, e.g., Acare 2020).
Overcoming Disciplinary Boundaries in Engineering Systems Design
The theories and processes for engineering design have shifted over time from enabling design of the primary functions of a product or a system to include the system in relation to its social context. Traditionally, design theories and processes have focused within disciplinary boundaries – for example, design of mechanical systems by mechanical engineers, electrical systems by electrical engineers, aerospace systems by aerospace engineers, software by software engineers, and so forth. The disciplines involved in production developed their own theories and processes in, e.g., manufacturing, production, and maintenance engineering. Where user interaction is paramount, industrial designers and graphical designers seek to combine knowledge from social, human, and artistic domains into the design activity. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the different disciplines need to be integrated to design engineering systems that meet the challenges of our time. These engineering systems also evolve. They are rarely defined from scratch, and once realised, they are subject to changes, upgrades, and addition of new functionalities throughout their operating lives (De Weck et al. 2011). Another issue that has become more prominent in the engineering systems design context is that of coordination and collaboration in situations where many design teams need to design together. In fact, Smith (1997) identified that ever since the division of intellectual labour became more prominent through the industrial revolution, there has been a need to actively integrate disciplinary knowledge in design and development. As products relied on increasingly diverse and refined disciplinary expertise with their own practices, theories, and tools, the interdisciplinary design challenge also grew. Therefore, there has been an incentive to overcome barriers and facilitate cross-disciplinary design and learning. This has to an increasing extent impacted theories and processes applicable for more complex engineered systems. In particular, it is well known that as the complexity of a development task increases, more people, design groups, and organisations need to coordinate their work and

share the same overall understanding of their undertaking. The complexity of the most complex products, like the moon rockets, has pushed collective human endeavour to its limits. Design theories and processes that are understood and shared are instrumental for success when developing these complex engineering systems. In this spirit, we see the design of engineering systems as discussed in this chapter to require the ability to define solutions that balance the behaviour of the forthcoming system, including how it interacts with its context. Designers also need to define solutions for problems that are non-trivial and seldom well-formulated. This requires deep mastery of disciplinary knowledge while also combining and integrating contributions from many domains. Modern systems typically combine electrical, mechanical, and software subsystems that consequently require mechanical, electrical, and software engineering considerations in design while operating in regulatory and political contexts. Increased attention to human aspects and differentiation on markets has accentuated the need to include industrial designers and other artistic disciplines. As products have become more interdisciplinary, complex, and interactive with their surroundings, they are increasingly seen as engineering systems themselves, in which the behaviour and performance of the system not only are determined by the behaviour of individual components, parts, and subsystems but increasingly by their interactions that contribute in important ways to the emergent behaviour of the system. Designing engineering systems thus requires overcoming disciplinary boundaries and combining a larger number of different disciplines than designing simpler products. As one of the consequences, design of engineering systems has embraced more abstract and generalised concepts such as architecture, modules, and platforms. Researchers and practitioners seek means to more effectively design for less concrete characteristics, the so-called ilities such as sustainability, maintainability, availability, and so forth (Ross et al. 2008). These issues and their interactions have always existed, but a greater focus on them during design has contributed to making systems safer, cheaper, and better-performing once in use. Overall, understanding how to design interactions and dependencies within and between systems is growing in importance. This is occurring alongside the growth in technology enabling connectedness (e.g., Internet of Things) and the increasing societal need for sustainable solutions.
Multiple Views on an Engineering System
To illustrate how products and systems can be seen in many different ways, we return to the example of the commercial aircraft and its interaction with, e.g., airport logistics. An aircraft is sufficiently complex to be described as an engineering system in itself but can also be conceptualised as a product and as a subsystem of a wider transportation system. The design and development of a new aircraft is a challenge in all its complexity, requiring the ability to make use of the latest achievements and advances in technology while always rigorously ensuring safety in the final product. A large aircraft has millions of parts and software modules that need to fit together

and work together to fulfil the overall function of air transport. However, there is more to aircraft design. Aircraft manufacturers also need to meet expectations of passenger comfort while being ever more sustainable and of course being affordable and available for airline operations. Manufacturers need to provide increasingly complex solutions while improving production cost efficiency and reducing lifecycle costs. There is also a need for modern aircraft to interact with other aircraft and the air traffic management systems. Critical parameters of a modern aircraft are monitored in real time in communication with on-ground resources. In sum, therefore, an aircraft design team needs to find the best balance amongst stakeholder needs and expectations, some of which are in conflict and might be initially ill-defined. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the task of designing an aircraft needs to be seen from many viewpoints but also must result in a coherent solution. Overall, handling the complexity of such tasks and interactions requires a structured, systematic, and systemic approach to design, to assure that all relevant aspects are covered to a sufficient standard. Considering this challenge, the rest of this chapter is motivated by three questions:
• What are the main perspectives on design that together provide a rich picture of the topic? • What are the dominant design theories and processes and where can I learn more? • How are key insights into engineering design of use for engineering systems design?
Engineering Systems as Socio-Technical Systems
This section introduces some important concepts and terminology that will appear throughout the chapter. Firstly, what is meant by an engineering system? For this chapter, we adopt the definition of De Weck et al. who define engineering systems as “a class of systems characterized by a high degree of technical complexity, social intricacy, and elaborate processes, aimed at fulfilling important functions in society” (De Weck et al. 2011, p. 167). In our view, engineering systems design has two main dimensions: the technical and the social. This is represented in the framework depicted in Fig. 2. In terms of the technical dimension, when designing a system, it is important to understand and define an initial boundary of the problem. Engineering systems have elements – subsystems – that when integrated define the characteristics of the system. Conversely, if the system is a part of a larger context and has clear interactions with that context, it is part of a system of systems, which according to Maier has two defining characteristics (Maier 1998, p. 271):
(1) Its component system[s] fulfil valid purposes in their own right and continue to operate to fulfil those purposes if disassembled from the overall system, referred to as “operational independence of the components”. (2) The component systems are managed (at least in part) for their own purposes rather than the purposes of the whole, referred to as “managerial independence of the components”.

Adopting Maier’s definition and applying it to our running example, an aircraft is a system, because it has its own purpose and is operated and managed in its own right. The aircraft interacts with other systems, such as airports, air traffic management, and fuel suppliers, to provide an aggregated function of transporting people or goods. An aircraft is thus a part of the air transport system together with air traffic control, on-ground logistics and infrastructure, and so forth. The air transport system qualifies as a system of systems. An aircraft, as a system, consists of a large number of subsystems that in turn are organised into modules, parts, and components. The engine is, for example, one of about 18 different subsystems of an aircraft (the precise number depends on the level of decomposition) together with wings, fuselage, landing gear, and so forth. Each of these is typically complex enough to be labelled systems in their own right, but when viewed from the aircraft context, they are defined as subsystems. Meier (1998) argues that subsystems must operate independently, and following his definition, the aircraft is not a system of systems. The distinction between system of systems, system, and subsystem also depends on the perspective of a particular design team and the target system they are focused on. For example, to the aircraft design team, an engine is a subsystem. But for the engine manufacturers, the engine itself is viewed as the target system – from this perspective, the aircraft is a higher-level system, while the individual parts of the engine are the subsystems. In other words, the definitions of system and subsystem are relative to particular designers, teams, or organisations. As long as a systemic view is beneficial, the division can be cascaded further. One challenge in designing engineering systems is that the behaviour of the targeted system and the system of systems in which it participates can be influenced by the behaviours of subsystems and their components on a much deeper level. In the case of aircraft, this becomes

evident when failures occur and the underlying reason is found “deep down” in any of the many subsystems and their components. This is a well-known weakest link situation, and for aerospace products, certification authorities therefore require a failsafe design strategy to avoid “any failure condition which would prevent the continued safe flight and landing” (Federal Aviation Administration 2020). Complementing the technical dimension that is described above, our framework of Fig. 2 emphasises that engineering systems also have a social dimension. The social dimension represents the variety of actors who interact with the engineering system. Three categories of actor are shown in Fig. 2 and discussed in the next paragraphs. The first category is the user. We note that the design process has at least two natural starting points: an existing design and the “users”, interpreted broadly. It is important to understand the users’ needs to design a system effectively. For an engineering system, there will usually be multiple user groups with different needs. The users of an aircraft would include the passenger, pilots, the crew, the maintenance personnel, etc. An example of a professional business actor falling into the user category is an airline that is also a customer of the manufacturer. Examples of users can often be clearly identified, each with individual needs and expectations that may or may not be well-defined. The next category is the stakeholder. Stakeholders are those actors who are affected by, or have an interest in, the outcome of the engineering systems design. Users are a special type of stakeholder, and their needs need to be considered together with those of other stakeholder groups – in the aircraft example, these other groups include airport neighbours, certifying authorities, business owners in manufacturing companies, and suppliers. Each group has their own expectations and needs – that are likely to involve conflicting interest. The third category of actor depicted in Fig. 2 is society. This represents even broader interests than stakeholders. Society can be represented by districts, regions, or global interests that communicate their needs and expectations via general means, such as conventions, agendas, laws, and directives. Societal needs apply to all actors and aspects of design. In aerospace, for example, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) organises global and normative conventions in which states are members, where, e.g., flight safety statistics and safety plans for the entire air transport system are considered. Societal needs and expectations have a direct link to all technical levels of an engineering system. An example in the aircraft design context is noise regulation that restricts noise emissions from flying. In this case, what is acceptable for humans living close to airports has been formulated as regulatory requirements that constrain all air transport actors by specifying allowable noise during certain times of the day around an airport. These regulations have influence on a systemof-systems level (e.g., on air traffic management – where and how to fly aircraft) and what noise emission levels are allowed from the aircraft itself, and the regulations are eventually cascaded down to design requirements on noise generating subsystems such as the engines. They can have a decisive impact on decisions made on lowest level of the system, e.g., enforcing noise reduction design

solutions to components in the engine or constraining the aerodynamic envelope of the wings and fuselage. Overall, engineering systems design must address technical issues on multiple system levels, and, in a similar way, designers must consider the social dimension of the engineering system on multiple levels, ranging from individuals to the global society. Design perspectives, theories, and processes can assist with these tasks.
The Role of Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes
The design of socio-technical engineering systems is a highly complex process without clear boundaries, which the different stakeholders approach in their own ways and from their own perspectives. Design, like any complex system, can only be understood in its entirety at a high level of abstraction or by adopting specific perspectives which shine a light on some aspects of design while subsuming others. The relationship between theories, perspectives, and processes is illustrated in Fig. 3. For the purposes of this chapter, we distinguish between perspectives on design, which each emphasises a particular aspect of socio-technical design, and design theories, which aim to be formal in the sense that the formality of an expression is defined as the invariance, under changes of context, of the expression’s meaning (Heylighen 1999). Design theories are often intended to be general but are not predictive as theories in science often are. Design processes describe design in terms of common activities that characterise designing at different levels of detail, scope, and specificity. It should be noted that this is only one perspective – the design research community has not adopted a universally agreed distinction between perspectives, theories, and processes. Design perspectives, theories, and processes collectively paint a picture of design and provide useful vocabulary, best practices, and tools and methods for people interested in the topic. Firstly, to give some examples of design perspectives, design has been studied from the perspective of rational decision-making supported by mathematical tools to help evaluate alternatives and also from the perspective of the ways designers think

when they approach design tasks. These and other perspectives will be discussed in forthcoming sections. Secondly, design theories are abstract conceptualisations of design as a generic process. Like any abstraction, each theory is a selection of elements for a specific purpose. A large number of different theories of design exist that each highlights a particular aspect of design, for example, in terms of the elements of technical systems or the status of the design knowledge generated at different points of the design process. Design theories provide a lens onto difficult design problems and can thereby help to identify mistakes or omissions. In particular, theoretical concepts can be helpful for thinking through complex aspects of product development. For example, over recent years, many companies are increasingly making use of technology readiness levels (TRLs) (Mankins 1995) which provide a measure for how mature a technology is with regard to an industrial application. TRL1 denotes an innovative technology with a proof of concept, whereas TRL9 denotes a technology that has been applied successfully in operation. Many practitioners understand how to interpret TRLs and know, for example, that a TRL6 means that a technology has been validated in relevant environments, but not yet in the real context of use. This removes the risk of misunderstanding or long explanations, and for safety critical applications, TRL6 is typically required before committing to product development using a particular technology. The boundaries between perspectives and theories are fluid; however, theories make an explicit claim to generality, whereas perspectives on design often imply generality by focusing on one aspect of design. The fascination that design holds for many researchers is that all of these theories and perspectives offer insight and still, when put together, are not enough to describe all aspects of engineering design. A range of influential theories will be discussed. Thirdly, design processes present design fundamentally as a series of steps (or activities) that lead from a starting point, often needs or opportunities, to an ending point, often a designed product or system. These overlap with perspectives and theories where the latter imply steps in which designers in the broadest sense individually or collectively engage. Some influential design processes will be discussed from the engineering systems design viewpoint. Perspectives, theories, and processes are often expressed through models, which as Stacey et al. (2020) analysed for process models have a complex relationship to the phenomenon they are modelling. They can be classified in many different ways. Wynn and Clarkson (2018) classify design and development (DDP) process models by their purpose and their scope. In terms of purpose, they define the following categories:
• “Abstract models convey theories and conceptual insights concerning the DDP. Such models have yielded important insights into design and development, and have inspired the creation of pragmatic approaches, but many of them do not directly offer guidance for practitioners. • Procedural models convey best practices intended to guide real-world situations.
62 O. Isaksson et al.


• Analytical models provide situation-specific insight, improvement, and/or support which is based on representing the details of a particular DDP instance. • Management science/operations research (MS/OR) models use mathematical or computational analysis of representative or synthetic cases to develop generally applicable insights into DDP issues”. (Wynn and Clarkson 2018, p. 164)
In terms of scope, they define another three categories:
• “Micro-level models focus on individual process steps and their immediate contexts. • Meso-level models focus on end-to-end flows of tasks as the design is progressed. • Macro-level models focus on project structures and/or the design process in context. This can include the overall form of a project or program, organisational and managerial issues relating to a DDP situation, and/or the interaction between the DDP and the context into which a design is delivered”. (Wynn and Clarkson 2018, p. 164)
Recalling that design perspectives, theories, and processes are often expressed through models, this chapter focuses on the abstract and procedural models described above. Ideas expressed in the analytical and management science models will be discussed in other chapters of the book. Design perspectives, theories, and processes have been strongly influenced by their application domains, such as urban planning, machine design, or information systems design as well as the education and traditions of the individuals creating them. The application domain also has a significant influence on the primary role that design plays and means that design is conceptualised in different ways, which are complementary but can be challenging to bring together as they use different vocabulary and set different priorities. To date, no single, unified perspective, theory, or process of design that fits all contexts has emerged. Rather, there are many approaches offering different and complementary views. It is certainly not possible to cover all aspects of design in a single chapter – in this case, the authors’ background in mechanical engineering and design studies means that the chapter is grounded in these disciplines, whereas perspectives, theories, and processes relating to, e.g., software design or electrical design may be less evident in the chapter. Design perspectives, theories, and processes can assist engineering systems design at all the levels indicated above by explaining, articulating, and prescribing how engineered systems are designed while also defining a set of concepts and a vocabulary that practitioners can use. Noting that some terms in the field are used in slightly different ways by different people, when describing each approach, we largely follow the terminology of the respective author(s). Understanding perspectives, theories, and processes for design benefits from appreciating the evolving nature of design theories and processes. The different perspectives, theories, and process are often a reflection of the issues that
3 Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes for Engineering Systems Design 63


concerned the products and periods in which their creators were working. In many ways, they evolve together with society itself. For example, systems engineering emerged in the middle of the last century when several engineered systems that still much influence our lives were created, such as the telecom industry, the computer revolution, mass air transport, and manned flight to the moon. Scientific breakthroughs in physics, chemistry, biology, and so forth enabled a range of technological innovations that are utilised in new products and systems by engineers. Mastery of technology was a route to success, and the systems engineering discipline emerged as a result of rationalising and explaining how to manage such technologically intense products and systems. For an overview of the history of systems engineering, see the previous chapter in this book. Since then, the globalisation of economy and the ongoing digital revolution have formed society into a more service-dominant logic in marketing (Vargo and Lusch 2008). The impact of the human way of living on our society and environment increasingly forms our society, where resource scarcity and ecological and socio-economic aspects grow in importance. Our ability to generate and process data, sometimes called the digital revolution (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011), is yet another cornerstone that drives societal development. There is also a clear trend that ownership of these engineering systems is no longer the natural choice for customers and users. We increasingly value what services and utility these products and systems can provide (Tukker and Tischner 2017). This has led to service-based business models where ownership of the engineering systems is no longer with the end customers and can be retained by the manufacturer. Naturally, these trends influence both what products and systems to develop and how these can be developed. Shifting societal values and new technological opportunities are explanations for the continuous update and evolution of design perspectives, theories, and processes. Design theory contributes to meeting engineering systems design challenges as they have been developed to address multifaceted and ill-defined problems. On the one hand, theories, typically being generalised in nature, are often rewarding when analysing and understanding ambiguous situations. Theoretical approaches, including perspectives and processes, provide strategies to address real-world problems such as how to handle existing dependencies and constraints. On the other hand, interactions between a system and its context are largely neglected in most existing engineering design theories, and this is a current area of development. Applications of perspectives and theories into methods and practical implementations require greater consideration of the incremental and evolving nature of the practical development of engineering systems. In summary, a vast number of theories, perspectives, and processes have been developed. There are complex relationships between them, and they can inform engineering systems design in a variety of ways. In this chapter, we focus on discussing a selection of design perspectives, theories, and processes (a) that have been influential in the field, (b) that have implications for engineering systems design, and (c) for which mature descriptions are available in English.

Overview of the Next Sections
The next sections provide an introduction to a selection of well-established design perspectives, theories, and processes applicable when designing engineering systems. Section “Theoretical Perspectives on Design” will discuss what is meant by design in the broad sense, unveiling some of the theoretical foundations and influential perspectives on design. Perspectives and theories provide insights and means to view and approach design problems, and their general nature makes them interesting for practicing and researching design, since “there’s nothing as practical as good theory” (Lewin 1951). In section “Design Processes”, we introduce design processes as a means to both understand and prescribe design and discuss how a selection of processes is relevant for design of engineering systems. Such processes typically adopt principal strategies to understand and organise a design problem and prescribe how to work towards addressing that problem. Some design processes are of generic nature that makes them more generally applicable to different problems. As such, they may require a certain degree of training to master so that the key concepts can be appropriately applied to the specific problem and context studied. Other design processes may be specific to certain application domains and can be expressed even as norms that need to be followed for certain design situations. One example is the design of pressure chambers, where certain design processes need to be followed to comply with safety regulations. These latter types of design processes will not be treated in this chapter. In section “Application of Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes to Practical Case Examples”, we discuss the utility of design perspectives, theories, and processes when designing engineering systems by raising how some of the challenges that are commonly faced can be met. Section “Conclusions” summarises important points to take away from the chapter.
Theoretical Perspectives on Design
Engineering systems design involves design at many different levels. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, it ranges (for instance) from the details of components to the system of systems and from consideration of material properties to aesthetic appeal and stakeholder satisfaction. However, the practice of a designer of turbine blades differs from the practice of, say, an interior designer. There are similarities at a certain level of abstraction, but also significant differences, and yet the term design is used in both cases. This raises the question: what do we mean by design? In his seminal book, The Sciences of the Artificial, the Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon defined design in perhaps its most general form as “to design is to devise courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones” (Simon 1969). On a more detailed level, design has been conceptualised in different ways and from different perspectives, each of which has its own justification and advantages.

Design research and therefore the formulation of design perspectives, theories, and processes began to gather momentum after the Second World War. Over the period since then, research has moved focus from technical details, such as machine elements or geometric properties, to include a broader appreciation of the importance of the user and the wider system. This section first discusses what we mean by design before introducing eight design perspectives, which when taken together, give an impression of the rich phenomenon of design.
The Scope of Design
Design is an everyday activity that we all engage in all the time. We design when we decorate and furnish our houses, arrange our gardens, and throw together a quick dinner. When we make things without following detailed instruction, we design, for example, when we make clothes or carry out many DIY tasks. We also design our experiences, when we plan a holiday or a children’s birthday party, where we pick existing offers and add our own to them (Papanek and Fuller 1972). While everybody to some extent does design and can design, design is also a research discipline and a professional practice that can be studied. In fact, the study of design as a generic activity – as opposed to the study of some specific design domains – is a relatively recent addition to the academic canon. When the Open University in the UK launched a course in the late 1960s called “the man-made world” (The Open University 2020), this was a pioneering and influential effort in design education. The course was set out to teach design as a generic activity across different domains and highlighted the responsibility of designers for society and the environment. Mass distance education required a decoupling of design theory and design practice, where the theory needed to be made explicit and applicable to design in different domains and illustrated through examples in different domains. This work to identify what is generic about design processes across all different domains still continues (e.g., Daly 2008; Reymen et al. 2006). Less effort has been placed on understanding how design processes in different domains are different and why (Stacey and Eckert 2010). Design research has typically perceived design as a generic process that applies to all design domains with the aim of identifying the common characteristics of all design problems and activities. However, individual researchers have approached design as a general subject from the viewpoint of their own domains, which has contributed to emergence of different perspectives in the discussion about design. What is included in the term “design” is approached from two fundamental angles, often associated with design as a noun, referring to a product or the styling of a product, services, systems, solutions, and design as a verb. Also the scope of what is included in “design” varies. For instance, design can be viewed as the specific cognitive processes that are involved or as the entire collective effort of designing a complex system in and across organisations. Two other definitions of design are:
66 O. Isaksson et al.


• “Everything that is associated with the design of a solution”. According to this perspective, design is the process of creating artefacts or systems and involves many activities that in themselves would not be considered to be design. For example, designing an air transport system including the aircraft involves many scientific, mathematical, and administrative activities that, according to this perspective, would be considered parts of the design process. • “Design as a unique activity”. In this definition every task that is approached in a designerly way is considered design (Cross 1982). According to this perspective, design also applies to many everyday activities such as planning a dinner party or a solving a business problem.
The conceptualisation of design processes will be discussed in more detail in section “Design Processes”. The term “design” has its origins in the Latin term designare meaning 1. indicate/ designate/denote; 2. mark; or 3. point/mark/trace out/outline/describe. From this comes the Italian word for drawing, disegno. In the sixteenth century, Giorgio Vasari introduced painting, sculpture, and architecture as the arti del designo (Burioni 2012). Italian and other European languages like German maintained the strong link between design and form-giving and have typically associated the term design with subjects that come from an art school tradition, such as product design, fashion design, or graphic design. In German, the term design is therefore focused on artistic aspects, while engineering systems design would be described as Entwicklung, i.e., development. The English term design is broader and encompasses any type of plan or specification for building of objects or systems and the process of creating such a plan. Consequently the English term design is applied to many different areas, much as mechanical design, industrial design or sometimes even systems engineering. In recent years, design or design thinking has also been adopted outside of traditional product design domains. The highly influential Cox Review of Creativity in Business (UK Government 2005), commissioned by the UK government, puts it like this: “design is what links creativity and innovation. It shapes ideas to become practical and attractive propositions for users or customers. Design may be described as creativity deployed to a specific end”. This is based on definitions that “Creativity is the generation of new ideas – either new ways of looking at existing problems, or of seeing new opportunities, perhaps by exploiting emerging technologies or changes in markets” and “Innovation is the successful exploitation of new ideas. It is the process that carries them through to new products, new services, new ways of running the business or even new ways of doing business. This has moved design and creativity into the centre of public discourse in the UK and argued for supporting creative industry as one of the drivers of UK economy (Design Council 2018). The definition adopted for the creative industries as those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property” (DCMS 2001, p. 4). They included not only traditional design fields such as architecture and artistic design domains such as product design, graphic design, or fashion but also the creation of cultural artefacts such as advertisement, media,
3 Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes for Engineering Systems Design 67


music, visual arts, and publishing. This included aspects of software design and IT, such as games design. This definition goes back to a study by Caves (2000), who investigated industry sectors in which the participants were driven by a passion for what they do and put up with a very uneven pay for similar tasks. Overall the scope of design is wide, with a clear movement to embrace design as a problem-solving and solution seeking approach for everyone. Recognising the commonalities and differences between different approaches can help to use them in a constructive way. In fact, engineering systems design combines many different aspects of design. The engineering challenges apparent when designing engineering systems require deep technological and scientific knowledge, as well as means to represent, manage, and control the evolution of complex systems such as aircraft and their interactions with users, stakeholders, and society.
Theory Meeting the Challenges of Design
Thinking about design has a long and august history. Aristotle (2014) draws (in his work on physics) a fundamental distinction between natural products, which are driven by processes of nature, and artefacts that are created by humans and will eventually vanish without human interventions. For many centuries, what we would now call complex products, such as aqueducts or cathedrals, were designed by people who learned their job as apprentices and acquired engineering knowledge as tacit knowledge (Ferguson 1992). Throughout the centuries, engineering knowledge has been developed and formalised to meet the needs of engineering designers (Vincenti 1990). Thereby the focus shifted with the products of greatest concern at the time. Renaissance books of mechanisms, as well as drawings and descriptions of machines, were systematically published and shared (Ferguson 1977). The first texts on engineering design can be found in the early nineteenth century, notably in the wake of setting-up the first technical universities, e.g., Ferdinand Redtenbacher (1848), who pointed out that machine-related knowledge alone is not sufficient. Effective design also requires a talent for invention and an understanding of the mechanical process that the machine must serve. A modern engineering systems designer would recognise technical knowledge, creativity, and an understanding of purpose and context as the constituent elements of successful engineering design. Since the Second World War, engineering design has become more structured and increasingly more based on mathematical and computational analysis (Ferguson 1992). Consequently, engineering design and its methods have today become very strongly influenced by the capabilities of the computational tools that support it. In the middle of the twentieth century, architectural design was a major driver of design theory development. For example, Alexander (1977) developed the idea of patterns in design, representing similar solutions at a fairly high level of abstraction. Computer science as a discipline developed some of its own theoretical foundations for design while drawing on general design theory, for example, the idea of software
68 O. Isaksson et al.


patterns built on Alexander’s ideas (Gamma et al. 1994). More recently, many of the different design research communities have fragmented and have developed their own vocabularies. Bringing the concepts, ideas, models, and methods of these different communities together is one of the challenges of future engineering systems design. This is much-needed to meet the expectations for design of engineering systems, in which the interaction with the system context becomes an essential issue to be considered during design.
Perspectives on Designing for Engineering Systems
As the scope of design research has broadened from the design of mechanisms and products to a systemic view, which considers not only products but the way we interact with them, the way design has been conceptualised has changed accordingly. In this section, we discuss different perspectives on design, each of which is helpful and useful yet only offers a partial view on design from the engineering systems perspective.
Design as Decision-Making
Design can be viewed as a process of making decisions that can be optimised by mathematical modelling and by applying principles of decision theory (Chen et al. 2012). In brief, this can involve specifying a problem in terms of constraints and objectives, identifying feasible solutions allowed by that problem definition, and determining which solution offers maximum value. Hazelrigg (1998) writes that viewing design in this way can help to ensure that important decisions are made rationally while taking into account the broader context, including the total lifecycle of the product or system. Thus, the decisionbased design perspective is especially pertinent to engineering systems design. One challenge in applying this approach is the high complexity of many real design problems, which necessitates simplification to make decision analysis tractable. Another challenge is appropriately evaluating solutions, considering how to identify and value conflicting stakeholder preferences and how to account for unpredictable or changing contexts of use. The sequence of decisions may affect the result, and some decisions may need to be treated concurrently (Mistree et al. 1993). Decisions are also made on different system levels, having the same originating top-level requirements. Hence requirements need to be systematically decomposed, or cascaded, while maintaining the original intent (e.g., Kim et al. 2003). These and other aspects of decision-based design have been studied by a number of researchers (e.g., Chen et al. 2012). One approach to dealing with the uncertainties endemic in engineering systems design while optimising design decisions is to apply real options theory, e.g., Cardin et al. (2017). Current research into decision-making systems in design also often emphasises the need for visual analytics as an interactive way to allow decisionmaker greater involvement and appreciation of the limits and trade-offs (Keim et al. 2008).
3 Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes for Engineering Systems Design 69


Design as Rational Problem-Solving
In 1969, Simon published his book The Sciences of the Artificial (1969). He distinguishes science, as concerned with what is, from technology, which is concerned with changing into preferred situations. This puts the desire to change and to improve at the heart of design, viewed as the activity that creates technology. Bunge (1966) sees technology as applied science in the sense that technology is about action that is underpinned with science unlike arts and craft. However, design has always stood between science and arts and crafts. This tension has dominated the debate on how design is conceptualised and how the rhetoric around design is constructed by different groups. Simon also puts forward a view of design as a rational problem-solving process applied to ill-defined problems. The principles of bounded rationality (Simon 1957) limit the designer’s ability to explore solutions. For most design problems, it is simply not possible for a human to fully gather all relevant information, explore all potential solution, and then settle for a best solution, so that designers “satisfice”, i.e., settle for a satisfactory solution rather than look for a best solution. He famously states that “everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones” (Simon 1996 p. 111). Simon (1969) argues that complex problems are almost decomposable. The overall design problem decomposes into smaller problems, which are connected and influence each other. The perspective that design involves (or should involve) a rational approach to problem-solving is embedded in many widely accepted design processes and practices, for example, by stipulating that a designer should progress from abstract considerations to more concrete ones or should seek to generate many possible solution concepts before selecting the best according to defined criteria.
Design as Reflective Practice
In 1983, Donald Schön published his book The Reflective Practitioner (1983). A number of architects were given the problem to design a school from scratch. As they sketched their designs, it became apparent that their behaviour was a mixture of making marks and then looking at them – reflecting about what they had done. When looking at the paper, they engaged in two different kinds of seeing, “seeing that”, i.e., recognising something, and “seeing as”, i.e., interpreting what they saw (Schön and Wiggins 1992). Schön called this process “a conversation with the situation”. The inherent ambiguity of sketches affords different interpretations of the same marks, and a designer is able to distance themselves sufficiently from their work to interpret design elements in different ways and use these as a starting point for a different design trajectory. Schön summarised this as an abstract cyclical process of:
• Naming: recognising an element as a meaningful entity and giving it its name at a suitable level of abstraction, e.g., calling a connected line a “square” or a “swimming pool” • Framing: in which different named objects are pulled together into a more general problem frame
70 O. Isaksson et al.


• Moving: in which the design is advanced within the current frame • Reflecting: in which the design is evaluated before the next cycle begins
Schön brought in perspectives on how to deal with the complexity of engineering systems by iterating between the abstract and the concrete based on the current state of design.
Design as Addressing Wicked Problems
Many design problems fall under the category of wicked problems, a term coined by Rittel and Webber (1973, p. 161). They state: “The formulation of a wicked problem is the problem! The process of formulating the problem and of conceiving a solution (or re-solution) are identical, since every specification of the problem is a specification of the direction in which a treatment is considered”. They argue that wicked problems have the following characteristics:
1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem. 2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule. 3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true or false, but good or bad. 4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem. 5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a “one-shot operation”; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly. 6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan. 7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique. 8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem. 9. The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem’s resolution. 10. The planner has no right to be wrong.
Rittel and Webber looked at town planning as an example of a wicked social problem that required a social action that could lead to a change of human behaviour and ameliorate the underlying problem. While it is debatable whether all design tasks have all these characteristics, many of the problems addressed by engineering systems design certainly do. Buchanan (1992) argues that “design problems are ‘indeterminate’ and ‘wicked’ because design has no special subject matter of its own apart from what a designer conceives it to be”. He sees this as in fundamental contrast to science, which he views as being concerned that principles, laws, and rules are necessarily embodied in subject matter. According to Buchanan, a designer operates on two levels: a general level, on which the designer forms ideas and hypothesis about the nature of products or the artificial word, and a practical level, being embedded in specific circumstances. In engineering systems design, many of the problems are incremental, i.e., existing solutions need to be upgraded or incorporated into a new version of the design, which makes many of the design problems
3 Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes for Engineering Systems Design 71


both partially over- and partially under-determinate. In the process of understanding and addressing, designers need to make sure that their problems are sufficiently well defined to address them. Engineering problems are in practice often overconstrained, while many artistic design problems are underspecified, so that designers embark in a constraint-seeking process to limit their options (Stacey and Eckert 2010). There are many examples of wicked problems in engineering systems design, especially in system-of-systems issues that involve people. For engineering systems design, it is unlikely that there are any “true” or even “optimal” solutions, but rather there are a range of alternative solutions that are better or worse for the situation. For instance, an aircraft has a range of conflicting objectives to deal with, both on the engineering level with safety or comfort and weight and fuel efficiency. To assess the goodness of the aircraft, the external conditions such as how and where to operate the aircraft, passenger load factors, turnaround time at airport, etc. need to be included. The interaction between the aircraft as a system and its context becomes a part of the engineering systems design. This illustrates how engineering systems design thus qualifies as a wicked problem according to Rittel’s criteria.
Design as a Unique Mode of Thinking
Cross (2006) carried out many interviews with famous designers to identify characteristics of their way of thinking, which he concludes goes beyond what ordinary designers or lay people would engage in. He termed this designerly thinking, taking a cognitive approach to how excellent design practitioners do design. This work represents some of the academic underpinning of the wider design thinking movement that is described in section “Design Thinking as a Universal Approach” Cross identified the following characteristics of designerly thinking:
• Rhetorical and exploratory: a designer explores and might break new ground and therefore might need to persuade colleagues or clients of the merits of the new design. To illustrate the rhetorical nature of design, Cross cites the architect Denys Lasdun (1965): “Our job is to give the client . . . not what he wants, but what he never dreamed he wanted; and when he gets it, he recognizes it as something he wanted all the time”. • Emergent: design problems are ill-defined, and as already discussed, designers reframe the problems many times throughout the design process. Cross quotes the architect Richard MacCormac (1976): “I don’t think you can design anything just by absorbing information and then hoping to synthesise it into a solution. What you need to know about the problem only becomes apparent as you’re trying to solve it”. • Intuitive and abductive: designers build conclusions based and partial information. Rather than having a full understanding of a problem, they lead formats to proposing a new solution. They see links between ideas that other would not. See, e.g., Dorst (2011). • Reflective: designers engage, as argued by Schön, in a dialog with external media.
72 O. Isaksson et al.


• Ambiguous and adventurous: designers can live with uncertainty and push the limits of what has been done so far or what would be expected of them. This also can entail a certain personal risk as they put their judgment at stake.
Design Thinking as a Universal Approach
The problems facing designers of engineering systems are often wicked, and there is rarely an obvious way forward. Typically, there are multiple stakeholders involved who may have conflicting interests. An overly systematic way to address such problem can easily get trapped in excessive and complex analysis efforts, without ensuring a successful outcome. Design thinking, according to Buchanan (1992, 2019), takes another approach to address such problems from a collaborative and co-creative view, which welcomes ambiguity. It stresses the coevolution of the design problem and the design solution, in which designing is seen as a way of understanding the problem and analysing the problem influences the design. Design thinking emerged as a problem-solving approach during the 1980s and has increased in popularity over the last decades, partially through the commercial success of companies such as IDEO and the applicability to address open problems in a wide range of disciplines. Brown (2008) also being the president of IDEO describes designing as an iteration between three pillars: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. In the inspiration phase, the emphasis lies on finding needs and opportunities and stresses observation and preferably presence of users, seeking to understand also “extreme” users. The idea is to both identify opportunities and see problems as sources of inspirations. A range of simple methods have been developed to support design thinking activities, many of which welcome interaction, building on each other’s ideas and viewing the task from different perspectives as means to liberate creativity (Gordon et al. 2019). The design thinking approach following the d.school at Stanford builds on five phases as below (Plattner et al. 2009):
• Empathise, the starting point by observing user preferences and discovering the user needs • Define, is about building awareness and gaining a deeper insight in their core problems and what opportunities may exist • Ideate, is the most creative phase. Usually a team exercise that embrace both quantity and quality of ideas of solutions • Prototype, following direct after ideation phase, by prototyping the ideas quickly (sketches, paper models) and building on each other’s ideas • Test, is the phase where prototypes are matured through testing and learning what works and does not
Design thinking as a universal problem-solving approach has gained significant recognition also outside the design research community as a means to utilise knowledge from “non” designers and engage users and stakeholders. As such, it has attracted attention in the business community (see, e.g., Liedtka 2018). What is less emphasised in design thinking is the often extensive engineering effort
3 Design Perspectives, Theories, and Processes for Engineering Systems Design 73


necessary to both define and evaluate the solutions (i.e., the test phase) where the situation so requires. In engineering, design thinking is usually employed in underconstrained or ill-constrained situations, where user engagement is also a means of getting user buy in for a future solution. Design thinking is less well suited to overconstrained technical problems, for example, in the turbine blade design within the aircraft design example.
Design as a Participatory Activity
An age-old criticism targeted at designed objects, in particular buildings and complex systems, is that users do not like them, and their needs are only partially met. This has given rise to the desire to involve users in the design process through what is called participatory design (Sanders et al. 2010), which is also closely related to cooperative design and codesign (Sanders and Stappers 2008). This approach is particularly prominent in architecture. Sanoff (2010) offers the following definition: “Participatory design is an attitude about a force for change in the creation and management of environments for people. Its strength lies in being a movement that cuts across traditional professional boundaries and cultures. Its roots lie in the ideals of participatory democracy”. Participatory design allows the user to be an active member of the design process and to improvise and create themselves as a means of discovering their own needs and desires for the object. Being part of the creation process also increases the willingness of users to accept the eventual result. However, the challenge is how to engage users at different stages of the process. At the beginning, the collection of needs, constraints, and requirements can be very abstract and difficult to express making it difficult for users to engage with the associated partial and abstract representations. Users often engage by critiquing early design suggestions, at which point many fundamental decisions are already taken and the users are biased by the visualisation they see. Later in the design process, information can become highly technical, so that users might not be able to understand the full implications. Participatory design also plays an important role in computer science, which has developed multiple methods for how to engage users (see Kensing and Blomberg 1998 for an early influential discussion). In computer science, this has given rise to movements, such as user-centred design (Norman and Draper 1986; Sharp et al. 2019) or “extreme programming” processes, which amongst other elements advocate frequent iteration loops with users, so that user can comment on parts of a computer systems and generate new requirements. In agile development, this has given rise to well worked-out methodologies for user engagement (Beck et al. 2001, Hartson and Pyla 2012). Participatory design deemphasises the technical aspects of design, which designers carry out almost behind the scenes. It is particularly valuable for design problems where the response by users (or category of users) is decisive for evaluating design alternatives.
Design as a Holistic Activity Beyond the Artefact
A product-service system (PSS) recognises that the value of an engineering system typically is associated to how well it performs in use, when provided as a service.
74 O. Isaksson et al.


Product-service systems equally acknowledge that the service provided depends on the characteristics of the product or system that enable service provision. Baines et al. (2007) provide a summary of PSS concepts, which all share the central theme that a PSS is an integrated combination of products and services. Designing a PSS solution requires both services and the physical artefact to be designed together with the business design. Early definitions of PSS emphasised the environmental advantages of combining products and services together such as Mont (2002), since the PSS model incentivises business to be more resource aware and enables shared use of (sub)systems across PSSs. According to Mont (2002), “PSS is a system of products, services, supporting networks and supporting infrastructure that is designed to be competitive, satisfy customers’ needs and have a lower environmental impact than traditional business models”. Another definition is offered by Tukker and Tischner (2017) who defined first the product-service as “a value proposition that consists of a mix of tangible and intangible service design and combined so that they jointly are capable of fulfilling final customer needs” and, second, the PSS as the “productservice including the (value) net-work, (technological) infrastructure and governance structure (or revenue model) that produces a product service”. How to design PSSs is still theoretically immature (Isaksson et al. 2009), yet the PSS business logic is highly attractive for businesses. Some of the apparent challenges of designing PSSs are (i) their intangible nature, following inclusion of services; (ii) the tangled relation with business and technology; and (iii) the lack of concise ways to evaluate the quality and value contribution of the PSSs. A service can be designed in advance and thereafter delivered as it is consumed by its customer. The evaluation of service performance requires therefore the customer response and perception to be included and makes the customers an integral part of the evaluation process. The PSS concept fits well with the increased ability to monitor data in use and sense how products and services are working, using IoT (Internet of Things). In recent years, the interest in PSS has broadened from an initial focus on sustainability to a perspective that brings together physical products with digitalisation technology and circular business models.
Section Summary
The eight different perspectives of design that have been described in Subsections “Design as Decision-Making”, “Design as Rational Problem-Solving”, “Design as Reflective Practice”, “Design as Addressing Wicked Problems”, “Design as a Unique Mode of Thinking”, “Design Thinking as a Universal Approach”, “Design as a Participatory Activity”, and “Design as a Holistic Activity Beyond the Artefact”, have arisen, in part, because researchers have focused on different aspects of design problems. Figure 4 illustrates a possible mapping between these design perspectives and the elements of engineering systems design that were presented in Fig. 2. In particular, design as decision-making (section “Design as Decision-Making”) arose from trying to select solution alternatives, such as the selection of a suitable compressor and turbine blade geometry, where objective and measurable criteria apply. Design as rational problem-solving (section “Design as Rational Problem-Solving”)

emphasises a broader problem, but one with goals and structure. Design as reflective practice (section “Design as Reflective Practice”) and design as a unique mode of thinking (section “Design as a Unique Mode of Thinking”) both highlight the importance of holistic and tacit thinking in design that goes beyond what can be mathematically modelled. For example, this is highly relevant when describing early conceptual design before equations are available. Design addressed as a wicked problem (section “Design as Addressing Wicked Problems”) highlights that in many design problems, the solution ought to work first time. For example, an entire airport can be prototyped and – as the infamous new airport in Berlin illustrates getting it wrong is highly costly (Fiedler and Wendler 2016). Recently these ideas have been broadened to designing the product and the processes in conjunction. What all these conceptualisations have in common is that they focus on the designer as a trained professional. The design thinking as a universal approach (section “Design as a Unique Mode of Thinking”) brings the user explicitly into a co-creative design process. In participatory approaches (section “Design as a Unique Mode of Thinking”), the user is the expert of its own needs, who can give feedback to the designer, whereas design thinking focuses on appreciating needs and generating innovative solutions. Both these focus on user experience and are less applicable for constrained safety critical applications. For such design, e.g., sizing and optimisation of reliable and efficient machinery, rational design strategies and decision-based design are more applicable. Complex designs involving lifecycle aspects and sustainability performance are candidates for design beyond the artefact (section “Design as a Holistic Activity Beyond the Artefact”) (Fig. 4).
Design Theories and Engineering Systems Design
We now move on from the discussion of design perspectives to the discussion of selected design theories of value to engineering systems design. These theories have several purposes, such as helping to establish a common vocabulary, to provide a background to tools and method development for design, and to frame design engineering design education. Different theories coexist, and a dominant paradigm is yet to evolve. Design theory has evolved as a field of its own to investigate general questions about design in the abstract, such as “what are the core phenomena of design? Is the discipline Design driven by novelty, continuous improvement, creativity, or imagination?” (Le Masson et al. 2013). Typically, theories aim to explain the phenomenon of design in its entirety, and many theories derive prescriptions how design should be done from their conceptualisation of design. Design theories are not just theories about what design is but in some cases also theories of how it should be done. Many of the theories are at the same time descriptive and prescriptive. Therefore, the term theories blurs into processes described in the following section. The authors themselves also variously refer to their theories as models, processes, frameworks, or ontologies. Design theories are general in nature and as such should be distinguished from investigation of specific design issues from a theoretical perspective

(e.g., Vermaas’ work on function in design, e.g., Vermaas (2013) or Eckert and Hillerbrand’s (2018) work on models in design). The rest of this section gives a brief overview of five influential theories of design that have been introduced over the last 50–60 years in the design research community. They also illustrate how theoretical development has evolved together with influential societal and scientific trends, increasingly emphasising universalism, abstraction, interventions, and systemic thinking. There are also many other established theories, each offering internally coherent frameworks and individual sets of vocabulary that help to think about design in a consistent way. The first theory to be mentioned is the theory of technical systems (TTS) (Hubka and Eder 1988) central to their framework for design science (Hubka and Eder 2012). This conceptualises a technical system as one in which a collection of engineering design activities, such as generating, retrieving, processing, and transmitting of information about products are applied to abstract descriptions of technical systems at different levels of detail as well as production process tasks, such as production planning, need to be carried out and economic, business, and societal issues need to be considered. A fundamental view is that design is about transforming something, called an operand, from an existing state to a desired state through a socio-technological transformation system. The operand comprises material, information, and/or energy states. The transformation system comprises of operands that are either human systems or technical systems that execute the transformation in an active environment, represented by the information system and the management and goal system. This system is shown in Fig. 5. TTS provides models for how energy, material, and information are transformed through the transformation process by the operands (see Fig. 5). Inspired by Hubka and Eder (1988), Andreasen (1980) introduced the domain theory where the basic idea is to view a product as systems of activities, organs, and parts and to define structure, elements, behaviour, and function in these domains. This inspired, e.g., Malmqvist (1997) and Mortensen (1999) to formally separate functional requirements from the means (design solutions that realise the functions) in a way encouraging formal modelling of design alternatives and customising configured products. For an update of domain theory, see Andreasen et al. (2014).

The TTS and its derivatives provide a systematic way of describing technical systems and introducing the ability to share an understanding of systems and processes from different perspectives. Hubka and Eder provided a comprehensive perspective on the elements of design and designing and pointers to universal solution principles. The domain theory by Andreasen and its derivatives strengthened ways to architect products and systems from their functional elements which have influenced systems modelling tools. Secondly, axiomatic design (Suh 1990) also describes design as a transformation of functional requirements into design parameters. Design is seen as a bootstrapping process where the functional requirements and design details are developed in increasing levels of definition, and functional requirements at a lower level of resolution are defined in response to design implementation decision already taken. It maps functional requirements to design parameters in matrices and advocates that designs should have a clear and separated mapping between functional requirements, as the multiple functions being carried out by the same product elements introduce risk. In doing so, axiomatic design holds that designers should adopt two axioms:
• The independence axiom. Maintain the independence of the functional requirements (FRs). • The information axiom. Minimise the information content of the design.
The axiomatic design theory provided a perspective on how to deal with the complexity of design, based on systematic decomposition of systems and linking in how elements of systems fit into a functioning unity. To systematically separate out what the solution does (FRs) from what it is helps designers to avoid being overly influenced by preconceptions. Designing compliant to axiomatic design principles can be beneficial in particular for modular designs. These issues of modularity and complexity are central for engineering systems design. Thirdly, the widely used FBS ontology proposed by Gero (1990) argues that design can be described through three classes of variables:
• Function (F) variables, which describe the teleology of the object, i.e., what it is for
• Behaviour (B) variables, which describe the attributes that are derived or expected to be derived from the structure (S) variables of the object, i.e., what it does • Structure (S) variables, which describe the components of the object and their relationships, i.e., what it is (Gero and Kannengiesser 2004)
According to FBS, designs are generated through the iterative application of eight processes (the arrows in Fig. 6) to these variables: formulation, synthesis, analysis, evaluation, documentation, and reformulation of the function, structure, and behaviour (see Fig. 6). Gero and Kannengiesser (2004) develop this further to reflect the situatedness of human cognition and applied to processes (Gero and Kannengiesser 2007). While the definition of function in FBS is intuitive to native speakers to

English, other notions of functions with associated theoretical frameworks exist (see Vermaas 2013; Crilly 2010). FBS brought a consistent framework for associating design variables to processes for reasoning about, and determining, desired behaviour of what is being designed. FBS is applicable to design activity on all levels of engineering systems, as shown in Fig. 2. Fourthly, C-K theory (Hatchuel and Weil 2009) claims to be a unified and formal design theory that argues that design can be modelled as the interplay between two interdependent spaces: the space of knowledge (K), which contains the propositions that are validated or assumed to be true, and the space of concepts (C), which are (yet) undecidable. The design process generates both knowledge and concepts and can be seen as moving between these spaces:
• K to C (disjunction): a concept is proposed based on knowledge. • C to C (expansion): a concept gives rise to a concept. • C to K (conjunction): a concept becomes established knowledge. • K to K (expansion): new knowledge is derived from existing knowledge.
The C-K theory focused on the appreciation of expansion of knowledge being generated and matured through the design. It expresses the fact that design is an interplay between the proposition of new ideas followed by testing and evaluation of the ideas to mature solutions. Finally in this subsection, the fact that design is a social process that carried out a rich context is explicitly included in the PSI framework (Reich and Subrahmanian 2020). The PSI framework holds that design plays out in three different spaces that need to be considered together:
F
Function
Be
Expected behaviour
Bs
Behaviour derived from structure
S
Structure
D
Design description

transformation

• The problem space (“What is being designed?”) covers the object that is designed and the process required to do so. • The social space (“Who are stakeholders in the design?”) covers the motivations and aspirations of those involved in the creation, use, and maintenance of the artefact. • The institutional space (“What is the institutional context in which the design is conceived, implemented, and operated?”) covers the economic, managerial, organisational, and political contexts that influence the product over the life cycle.
These spaces are connected, and changes spread between them. If the spaces are misaligned, problems can occur, which in turn might become a design problem in their own right. PSI makes explicit that design is a socio-technical processes and that failure of design projects is not necessarily caused by problems with the product but can arise from a lack of understanding and effort invested into the social and institutional space. PSI represents recent contributions as an engineering design theory addressing societal interaction and that the design goes way beyond the product. The effect of design requires the interaction with its context to be adequately designed as well. In summary, the five influential design theories have been selected as they cover a spectrum, ranging from the specific and artefact focused to the system of systems and wider societal aspects. This also follows a chronological order of when they have emerged. In other words, initially, engineering design theories focused on technical challenges, whereas more recently, design theories also address the interactions with society and other systems. Some approaches are intuitive and heuristically defined, such as Suh’s axiomatic design principles (Suh 1990), while others focus on categorising and organising design as a scientific discipline (e.g., Hubka and Eder 2012). Yet others focus on what is being designed (e.g., Gero and Kannengiesser 2004) or the tension in knowledge exploration in the C-K theory (Hatchuel and Weil 2003). In short, most theories offer a perspective and serve to bring a structure for understanding and clarity from this perspective and to its governing context. For more comprehensive lists, comparisons, and discussions of engineering design theories, see, for example, Le Masson et al. (2013), Eder and Weber’s (2006), or Chakrabarti and Blessing (2014).
Design Processes
Processes of creating and developing designs can be viewed, broadly, as descriptions or prescriptions of how the activity of designing unfolds over time (or is thought to unfold or expected to unfold). Design processes complement design perspectives and theories by providing more explicit guidance on how to approach design. By encapsulating philosophies of how the work should be done and organised, process models may help to align process participants and their mental models. They are, therefore, important enablers of design coordination, which becomes more important

in situations of high complexity – common in the engineering systems context. Process models depicting best practice (of generic or specific nature) are valuable to convey insights about how to do design and how to organise it and so are an important tool in education and training. Such models are helpful to prescribe and understand design, as well as to control, manage, and align design work in and across organisations. Some of the main value of a process is simply to communicate how to do design work, which is especially useful where the task at hand is new to the designer or infrequently encountered. Processes also help to avoid overlooking important steps or issues in a particular design context. Research and practice have considered design processes from various perspectives. In this section, some well-established design processes are introduced, and their relation to the perspectives and theories mentioned above is discussed. The process models discussed here originate mainly from mechanical engineering design and engineering product development, but as will be explained, many of the insights in the processes are applicable to the engineering systems design context. The term process is used in various ways in colloquial and research language. It is sometimes used to refer to what actually happens during design and sometimes perhaps more frequently – used to refer to the particular steps and their organisation that are supposed or expected to be followed. For this chapter, it is important to carefully distinguish between the process itself and a model of that process. A process model is in essence a simplified representation of a process that focuses on specific issues deemed important by the model’s creator, helping to communicate those issues while leaving others out. The following section discusses design processes as represented in some well-known explicit process models. The discussion of process models in this section is organised broadly around the classification of such models presented by Wynn and Clarkson (2018). These authors write that process models consider the design and development process at three levels, namely, the micro-level, meso-level, and macro-level. The distinction between these levels focuses on the scope of the process considered by a particular model, which is not necessarily the same as the number of people involved and the timeframe or the scale of the design situation. To recap from section “Introduction”, micro-level models emphasise individual activities and their immediate contexts. Meso-level models concern end-to-end flows of work related to the progression of a design. Macro-level models concern the interface between the design process and its context, including project structures. Aside from scope, process models come in different types aligning to the purpose intended for the model. The present section focuses on only one of the model types and purposes: procedural models, which are intended to provide best practices for design and development in the context of engineering systems. Abstract models provide conceptual insights (the design theories described earlier often incorporate abstract process models). The other two types of process model, namely, analytical and MS/OR models, are intended to represent specific situations or classes of situation to generate situation-specific or general insights for improvement. These two types of model are outside the scope of this section, but some are discussed elsewhere in the book.

There are numerous process models of each type and at each level of scope. Noting that the focus of this section is on engineering systems design, the framework presented by Wynn and Clarkson (2018) is reinterpreted for this context in Fig. 7. The figure indicates how the design theories discussed in section “Design Theories and Engineering Systems Design” fall into the abstract category of the aforementioned framework, and the process models to be discussed in this section fall into the procedural category, while the perspectives on design discussed in section “Perspectives on Designing for Engineering Systems” are relevant to all

types and scope of process model. The next subsections revisit some points from Wynn and Clarkson (2018) with consideration to the engineering systems design context.
Micro-level Procedural Design Process Models
Process models in this category capture overall strategies for design and design problem-solving. They often emphasise the iterative nature of design as well as the divergent/explorative nature of design that is articulated by Cross (1982), as described in the design perspectives subsection. These models apply to design activity on all of the subsystem, system, or system-of-systems levels articulated in Fig. 2. A strategy that is commonly articulated in micro-level process models is that designers should follow a series of cycles, on each cycle working through the issues systematically and trying to avoid jumping to solutions based on their preconceptions. Evbuomwan et al. (1996) review work from the 1960s incorporating this recommendation, including Marples (1961), Jones (1963), and Archer (1965). Each of these authors recommends that design should follow the three main steps of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. During analysis, the designer is expected to focus on a particular design subproblem and then work to structure it, yielding a set of objectives. During synthesis, they should generate multiple solutions. Evaluation involves the critical appraisal of those solutions against the objectives resulting from the first step, allowing the best design to be selected and yielding insight for iterative improvement. Design process models incorporating this strategy are often described as problem oriented because they stipulate starting from analysis of the problem to be solved on each design iteration (Wynn and Clarkson 2005). They suggest that within an iterative cycle, designers can formulate problem statements that do not presuppose a solution, which is desirable to help combine systematic reasoning with creative insights. Another common recommendation is to begin by deliberately expanding the perceived boundaries of a design (sub)problem when it is encountered, e.g., by relaxing constraints, attempting to reframe the problem, or attempting to perceive it on a higher level of abstraction. This is conveyed, for example, by the well-known Design Council Double Diamond model of the design process (Design Council 2007). These recommendations have parallels in several of the design perspectives discussed earlier. It is thought that approaching a process in this way may help to remove unnecessary constraints and ensure that a broad range of potential solutions is considered. A third common strategy is to decompose each encountered design problem into simpler subproblems with well-defined interactions as early as possible, such that the subproblems can be addressed individually prior to recombining solutions. As well as helping to make complex more problems manageable, this approach helps to divide work amongst team members (VDI2221 1987). Of course, the success of this strategy is highly dependent on how the problem is decomposed and how well the dependencies between its parts are managed during design.

Overall, the design strategies discussed in this paragraph are desirable and generally accepted as best practice but quite conceptual in nature such that practical implementation remains a challenge. Wynn and Clarkson (2018) write that they are for this reason often embedded in meso-level process models that are more concrete and specific for particular design tasks. Some examples of such models are described in the next subsections. Of all the design processes discussed in this section, microlevel process models are most similar to the design perspectives described earlier, and, as indicated, they directly embody parts of these perspectives as recommendations for practice. In contrast to design theories, their emphasis is on conveying accepted best practices for design rather than presenting unified, formal theories of what design involves.
Meso-Level Procedural Models
The micro-level models, as mentioned above, tend to be quite conceptual in nature. But many problems encountered during engineering systems design require resolution of specific technical issues. Meso-level design process models address this issue. These models essentially aim to support the generation of good designs in an effective and efficient manner by prescribing steps to be followed systematically. Some models of this type are very specific to a particular technical issue or company context. Others are more general in nature. With regard to the framework of Fig. 2, they are mainly focused on design problems appearing on systems or subsystem levels. An early example of a meso-level process model is Evans’ design spiral, which emphasises the iterative nature of the design process (Evans 1959). While his paper is focused on the specific issues of ship design, the form of the model depicts generally applicable insights about the process of addressing interdependent technical problems in engineering design. Noting that one of the most fundamental characteristics of design is the need to find trade-offs between interdependent factors, Evans argues that design cannot be achieved by following a sequential process alone. His model demonstrates how a structured iterative procedure is adopted to resolve such problems; early estimates are made and repeatedly refined as the design progresses, until the interdependent variables are consistent with each other. As the design moves forward, these design considerations are gradually refined by repeated attention until a solution that balances all of them is reached. At each iteration, the margins available to absorb changes decrease as the interdependencies are gradually resolved, smaller modifications are required, and higherfidelity design and analysis tools may be applied to each problem. Evans notes that the effort required to progress the design, and the number of people that are involved, can often increase as the solution converges. Other meso-level models present the engineering design process as a series of stages, each of which creates additional information to further concretise and detail the emerging design. In the mechanical design context, this stage-based form is exemplified in the early work of French (1999), originally published in 1971. Later
