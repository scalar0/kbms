Rocket Staging
Staging Methods:
*For Parallel Staging: Mass of 1st stage propellant from large tank is equal to the total mass of the large tank’s propellant times the fraction of the 1st stage burn time over the total burn time of the 1st and 2nd stages.
Stage Mass Relation: N-stage vehicle, the ith-stage has,
M0i = MPi + MSi + MLi
Payload Ratio:
λi ≡ M0(i+1)
M0i − M0(i+1)
= MLi
M0i − MLi
= MLi
MPi + MSi
*Equal for all similar stages, λi = λ(i+1) = ⋯ = λN

Structural Coefficient:
εi = MSi
M0i − M0(i+1)

M0i − MLi

*Equal for all similar stages, εi = ε(i+1) = ⋯ = εN
Mass Ratio:
Ri = M0i
M0i − MPi

Propellant Feed Systems Pressure-Fed Systems:
Deliver Pressure > Tank Pressure,
Ph = ρ(g + a)h
Expander Systems:
*Fuel is expanded to gaseous form to drive turbine that powers pumps which then push propellant into CC. - Low/moderate thrust applications - Often used for upper stage engines
Combustion Tap-Off Systems:
*Uses combustion product gas from combustion chamber to drive gas turbine that then drives pumps. Open Systems: - Turbine exit gas pressure low, dumped overboard Closed Systems: - Turbine exit gas dumped into nozzle at low pressure location to add ṁ p at nozzle exit *Moderate/high thrust (Saturn I-B/Blue Origin)
Gas Generator Systems:
*Part of fuel and oxidizer are burned in preburner to produce high-pressure gas that drives turbopumps. - Preburner operated very fuel-rich to keep temperature sufficiently low - Fuel-rich exhaust dumped overboard (open) or dumped into nozzle (closed) - Power controlled by adjusting fuel/ox rates into preburner - Can achieve higher CC pressure than expander sys.
Staged Combustion Systems:
*All propellant is burned in two stages (nothing wasted). First in fuel-rich preburner, then in main CC. - Allows very high CC pressures (high thrust) - Can be used with any liquid propellants - More efficient than gas generator (all fuel burned) - Requires very high-pressure turbopumps

Propellants and Aerothermochemistry
Propellant Types:
Liquid Propellants: Fuels: a) Cryogenic
- LH2 – liquid hydrogen (20 K) “deep cryogen” - LCH4 – liquid methane (111 K) b) Non-cryogenic - RP-1 – kerosene [C1H1.96] - ethyl alcohol – [C2H5OH] c) Hypergolic (Ea ≤ 0) (reacts on contact with oxi.) - hydrazine [N2H4] - monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) - unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) Oxidizers: a) Cryogenic - LOX – liquid oxygen - LF2 – liquid fluorine - FLOX – fluorine-enhanced LOX - N2O4 – dinitrogen tetroxide b) Non-cryogenic - N2O – nitrous oxide - N2O4 – dinitrogen tetroxide - ClF5 – chlorine pentafluoride
Monopropellants:
* Both fuel and oxidizer are contained in the same molecule; contact with a catalyst bed initiates reaction (breaks oxidizer and fuel components apart). * Usually used for RCS and in-space propulsion at low-mid thrust applications. - hydrazine (N2H4) + granular Al w/iridium coating - hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) + many possible catalysts - nitromethane (CH3NO2) - ethylene oxide (C2H4O) - nitrous oxide (N2O) - hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) (H4N2O4) Solid Propellants:
* Both fuel and oxidizer are initially in solid form. Homogenous Propellants: * Fuel and oxidizer are contained in the same molecule or in a homogeneous mixture. - nitroglycerine + nitrocellulose C3H5(NO2)3 + C6H7O2(NO2)3 - Single/Double/Triple base propellants Metal powders often added to increase heat of combustion. Heterogeneous (composite) Propellants: * Heterogeneous mixture of oxidizing crystals held in an organic plastic-like fuel “binder” a) Fuel Component (common binders) - hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) - rubber/asphalt b) Oxidizer Component (ground crystals of one or more of the following) - ammonium perchlorate (AP) - ammonium nitrate (AN) - nitronium perchlorate (NP) - potassium perchlorate (KP) - potassium nitrate (PN) - cyclotrimethylene trinitomine (RDX) - cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) * The combination of fuel/ox specifies the propellant (e.g. AP-HTPB, KP-HTPB, ...) Many possible combinations.
