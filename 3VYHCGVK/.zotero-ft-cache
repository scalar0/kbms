Abstract—Product service systems (PSS) can be understood as an innovation / business strategy that includes a set of products and services that are realized by an actor network. More recently, PSS that comprise System of Systems (SoS) have been of increasing interest, notably in the transportation (autonomous vehicle infrastructures, multi-modal transportation) and energy sector (smart grids). Architecting such PSS-SoS goes beyond classic SoS engineering, as they are often driven by new technology, without an a priori client and actor network, and thus, a much larger number of potential architectures. However, it seems that neither the existing PSS nor SoS literature provides solutions to how to architect such PSS. This paper presents a methodology for architecting PSS-SoS that are driven by technological innovation. The objective is to design PSS-SoS architectures together with their value proposition and business model from an initial technology impact assessment. For this purpose, we adapt approaches from the strategic management, business modeling, PSS and SoS architecting literature. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to the case of an automobile PSS.
Keywords—PSS, system of systems, system architecture, collaborative services, service engineering, business model, value proposition
I. INTRODUCTION
Classic system of systems (SoS) engineering in a defense and aerospace context is typically characterized by a governmental agency that defines the capabilities of the system of systems (see for example [1]–[4]). The main task of engineering the system of systems then consists of how these capabilities can be implemented by a (often given) set of actors and (existing or new) systems [3], [5]–[10]. More recently, systems of systems engineering has extended to areas such as transportation [10], [11] and energy [12] that have different characteristics than classic system of systems: There is no clear client a priori who sets the desired capabilities and
the actors that participate in the system of systems are not yet identified. In addition, these actors have not collaborated with each other before. The challenge from a systems of systems engineering perspective is that this situation vastly increases the number of SoS alternatives. Furthermore, proper incentive structures and value propositions need to be in place for encouraging actors to participate in the SoS. The existing SoS literature which deals with this type of SoS rather deals with an already given architecture or a predefined design space. For example, [13]–[15] analyze the resilience of an existing energy infrastructure architecture. [16] and [10] focus on the analysis of SoS transportation architectures, where the architecture alternatives are already given. Hence, the design of the SoS architecture itself does not seem to be sufficiently addressed, with a few exceptions [7], [17], [18]. Apart from the SoS domain, a distinct stream of literature deals with systems that consist of a set of product(s) and services, realized by a network of actors and a supporting infrastructure [19]–[22]. Such systems are called product service systems (PSS). More precisely, a PSS is a “system of products, services, networks of ‘players’ and supporting infrastructure that continuously strives to be competitive, satisfy customer needs and have a lower environmental impact than traditional business models.” [23] PSS can be understood as an element of an innovation / business strategy that aims at tapping new revenue streams from existing markets and delivering environmentally sustainable solutions [21], [24], [20]. Although a few publications have pointed at the obvious connection between PSS and SoS [25], [26], neither the PSS nor the SoS literature seems to have dealt in depth with PSSSoS. Hein et al. [19] define a PSS-SoS as “a set of products, services, infrastructures, and networks where its constituent elements exhibit operational and managerial independence”, referring to the two key characteristics of SoS of operational and managerial independence in Maier [27].

SoS usually have some of the following characteristics, as presented in [19] and as illustrated in Figure 1: • Multiple actors providing lower-level services that are combined into a higher-level service via collaborations. • Collaboration between actors from industries that have no track-record of collaborating becomes important, for example, the collaboration between car manufacturers and energy suppliers in vehicle-to-grid applications [28]–[30]. • Addressing societal concerns such as pollution reduction, quality of life, and job creation become crucial for getting approval from public stakeholders. • Governance and management of the combined service and physical products becomes a key issue, e.g. one central actor has oversight vs. no single actor is responsible for the overall system, which is a typical topic in the SoS literature [31]. • New technologies often trigger its development such as autonomous driving, electric vehicles, and smart grid [28]–[30].
Such PSS-SoS have the potential to address some of society’s most pressing challenges, but little is known about how to design them. Neither the existing PSS literature nor the existing SoS literature seems to provide sufficient guidance on designing PSS SoS [19].
Figure 1: Collaborative product service system
In the following, we propose a methodology for architecting PSS-SoS at an early stage, focusing on SoS that are, according to Maier’s SoS taxonomy [27] directed or collaborative, and are technology innovation-driven (technology push) [32].
II. A METHODOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTING COLLABORATIVE
PSS
This research was conducted in the context of the French automotive company Renault, in an effort to systematize the development of PSS-SoS. For simplicity, we abbreviate PSSSoS by PSS in the following.
A. Methodology Requirements
In order to understand the requirements of a PSS
architecting approach at Renault, the authors have engaged in
discussions and collaborations with different internal
stakeholders (R&D, product, service, business). These
interactions took place in regular workshops for developing
PSS concepts, team meetings, outreach meetings, and one-to
one conversations during a period of one year (2017-2018).
From these interactions, a set of requirements for a PSS
engineering methodology were elicited:
• Support the identification of potential impact of the
PSS on societal factors,
• Support the exploration of different PSS concepts
with regards to business development objectives,
• Support the identification of potential collaborations,
• Support the identification of value propositions (pains
and gains / pain relievers and gain creators),
• Support the development of a business model canvas
like representation around a PSS concept, and,
• Support the development of PSS architectures that
provide sufficient detail for the technical domain for
deriving high-level requirements.
B. Methodology Process Steps, Inputs and Outputs
The principal objective of the methodology is to derive PSS
architectures together with their value propositions and
business models. The focus is on technologies, which are
expected to have a large societal impact. The main inputs and
outputs of the methodology are shown in Figure 2. As inputs,
the technology under consideration is required. A technology is
understood as a combination of an artifact and its underlying
competencies that allow for its development, production, and
operation as defined in the technology maturity literature [33]
[35]. In addition, the field of interest is a set of domains such as
an area of economic activity (e.g. energy, insurance) for which
the potential impact of the technology is of interest. The
outputs address the previously defined requirements. The PSS
architecture provides a starting point for stakeholders in the
technical domain refine the architecture. Stakeholders from the
business domain are mainly interested in the resulting value
proposition and business model.
54


Figure 2: Methodology inputs and outputs
The methodology comprises two main steps, as shown in
Figure 3. The first step essentially addresses the technology
push case where the impact of a set of technologies on specific
domains are assessed. This step was introduced, as we
observed that technology push seems to be a common mode in
the Renault context and the automotive industry in general. The
main question in the technology push case is, what potential impact the technology has on its context and how adequate PSS
value propositions and PSS concepts can be developed that use
the technology.
In the second step, starting from the outputs of the first step
(PSS stakeholder network, PSS concept and value proposition
alternatives), the PSS architecture and PSS business model
alternatives are developed. The rationale behind the second
step is to provide system architects with a sufficiently detailed
description of the PSS architecture that allows them to start
working on their specific product or service architecture.
Analogously, the resulting business model intends to provide
business developers with a sufficient description to start
working on a more detailed description of the business model.
Figure 3: Main methodology steps
C. Collaborative PSS concept and Value Proposition Development
The main purpose of this step is to generate alternatives for
PSS concepts and value propositions starting from a
technology and fields of interest, as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4: PSS concept and value proposition development step
It starts with the elicitation of potential impacts of a
technology on one or more fields of interest, as shown in
Figure 5. The technology and fields of interest can stay generic
and little detail is required. For example, artificial intelligence
could impact the field of logistics, medicine etc. Autonomous
driving can impact urban areas, transportation, and energy.
However, it is often difficult to articulate the impact on a field
of interest, as technologies at low maturity levels lack
sufficient detail to relate them to impacts. Two concepts are
introduced to support impact identification. First, we introduce
capabilities, i.e. what the technology allows for. For example,
autonomous driving can lead to the capabilities of driver-less
operation of a vehicle in all conditions. For artificial
intelligence, a capability could be image recognition or
automated translation.
Figure 5: Technology impact assessment
Second, each field of interest contains key performance
indicators. These are indicators that are of general concern for
various stakeholders in a field of interest. For example, within
the field of interest “energy”, energy price is a key indicator
among others. For transportation, availability, cost, and
reliability are important indicators. The reason we introduce
key performance indicators is that it is often easier to identify technology impacts with respect to a key performance
55


indicator. For example, autonomous driving could lead to a
decrease in transportation cost, as no driver is required. Once a
potential impact has been identified, it is documented,
including the rationale why this impact is expected, e.g.
transportation cost decrease due to omission of a driver.
Furthermore, as is common for scenario analysis and
strategic forecasting, time horizons for the field of interest need
to be defined. This is particularly important with regards to the
technology under evaluation. For example, we can look at the
field of interest of transportation in 2025, when level 5
autonomous driving is expected to exist.
This helps to prioritize the potential impacts, not only in terms
of the importance of the impact, but also in terms of the
associated uncertainties. These prioritized potential impacts are
used in the next step.
Although technology impacts have been identified in the
previous step, it is still unclear how specific stakeholders
perceive these impacts. Hence, in the second step, stakeholder
pains and gains with respect to the potential impacts are
identified. We draw from the business model literature and
adapt the notion of “pains” and “gains”, as used in Osterwalder
et al. [36] to express pains and gains of a stakeholder with
respect to a technology impact. As the autonomous driving
example shows, the potential impact on a key performance
indicator comes without a value judgement. Autonomous
driving has the potential to decrease transportation cost.
However, this potential impact will be perceived very
differently by different stakeholders. For example, professional
drivers are likely to oppose transportation cost reduction, in
case their salary diminishes. On the other hand, passengers are
likely to welcome a decrease in transportation cost. Figure 6
shows the pains and gains for two autonomous driving impacts
on the domain of transportation.
Figure 6: Sample stakeholder pains and gains for an autonomous driving case
Once the pains and gains of stakeholders have been
identified, they are used for developing the PSS concept and
value proposition. For this purpose, we adapt the value
proposition design from Osterwalder et al. [36]. They introduce
a representation of value proposition which is based on a
customer segment’s pains and gains on the one hand and pain
relievers and gain creators associated with a set of products and
services on the other. The task of the value proposition
designer is to find adequate matches between the pain relievers
and gain creators and the pains and gains.
As collaborative PSSs involve a network of actors, value
proposition from Osterwalder et al. needs to be adapted. First,
we replace customer by stakeholder, as the notion of customer
would be too narrow in the case of collaborative PSSs.
Furthermore, we do not only consider pains and gains of
stakeholders with respect to their activities but we also take
pains and gains with respect to the technology under
consideration into account. In Figure 7, the technology impact
along with the pain relievers / gain creators to clients, shop
owners, and the local government are shown. As in
Osterwalder et al.’s value proposition design [36], the left hand
side consists of the products and services. The products and
services are not limited to those products and services that are
based on the technology under consideration. Here,
autonomous driving is infused into a vehicle, resulting in a robo vehicle. In addition to the robo vehicle, the service of a
contextualized advertisement feed is added. It takes
advertisements from local shops and feeds them to passengers.
The capability of this service is added to the “capabilities” box
and supports the “increased sales” gain creator for shops. The
set of products and services along with their capabilities are
called “PSS concept”. The notion of “concept” in this context
has been borrowed from [37], where a concept comprises a
system or product, eventually its components, along with its
main function.
Figure 7: PSS value proposition
This adapted value proposition representation allows for a
systematic reasoning over PSS alternatives and how they
impact stakeholders. Note that at this point only the capabilities
that generate / support pain relievers and gain creators are
considered. Furthermore, contributors to the PSS such as
service providers are not represented. A more detailed
description of the PSS that includes these elements is
developed in the subsequent step.
D. Collaborative PSS Business Model and Architecture Development
In order to evaluate the feasibility of the PSS concept and
value proposition, two additional steps performed: One with
respect to business model development and the second with
respect to the development of the PSS architecture. In the first
step, the business model for the value proposition is developed,
including key partners, activities, resources, sources of
revenue, and costs. Based on the business model, the PSS
56


architecture is developed, where actors are linked to the
products and services. The two steps are shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8: PSS business model and architecture
development step
The business model is developed around the PSS value
proposition, shown in Figure 7. The pain relievers and gain
creators are directly adopted, together with the stakeholders.
However, the business model canvas from [38] provides the
possibility to display more elements that comprise a business
model, as shown in Figure 9. We use the canvas, as it is well
known in the business domain and provides a shared vocabulary that translates between the technical and business
domain.
Figure 9: Targeted advertisement and transportation
PSS business model canvas
First, for delivering the value propositions, certain key
activities and key resources are required. In this case, the robo
vehicle and advertisement service need to be operated.
Furthermore, these activities require resources such as robo
vehicles, contextual data, and a service platform. These
activities and resources are provided by a set of stakeholders
called key partners. For collaborative PSS, some of the stakeholders can be at the same time customers and partners,
such as local shops. Contrary to the classic business model
canvas, the canvas developed here is not from a specific
organization’s perspective. It rather displays how a set of
stakeholders provides activities and resources to support value
propositions. It has therefore similarities with the RCOV
framework from [39]. Finally, cost structure and revenue
streams are identified such as the cost of transporting
passengers, cost of data collection and analysis, and the
revenues generated by the service via additional sales.
The business model canvas provides important information
for the subsequent architecture generation step, such as the
underlying resources and the set of partners that contribute to
the PSS. Figure 10 shows a sample PSS architecture which
includes the key partners from the business model canvas and
some of the key resources. In addition, the constituent services
of the PSS are defined. For example, for realizing the value
proposition “Price reduction for clients using service”, some
form of traceability is required, in order to verify that
customers have actually used the robo vehicle service. The constituent service “customer tracing” is based on a customer
card. Of course, alternatives exist. Furthermore, a key resource
is the service platform that allows for exchanging data between
resources used in the services. In addition, the contribution of
key partners to the constituent services and products / resources
are explicitly defined. Collaborating actors are shown at the
bottom of the figure, where the ad service provider and the
robo vehicle service operator jointly operate the service
platform.
Figure 10: Targeted advertisement and transportation
PSS architecture
Using the PSS architecture description, a first architecture
specification is provided to system architects who are working
on the architecture of a constituent product or service. For
example, the definition of the service platform in Figure 10
specifies that it will be used for running three services and it is developed and / or operated in collaboration with the
advertisement service provider and the robo vehicle service
operator. It is easy to imagine alternatives to this constellation,
e.g. the services are operated on different platforms. This PSS
architecture description addresses the gaps of existing PSS and
SoS approaches for representing PSS-SoS architectures as
described in [19]: different service / product configurations,
actor / stakeholder collaborations, supporting networks and
infrastructure, and roles of actors (ownership, operation).

III. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents an approach that is currently under
development at Renault focusing on architecting product
service systems (PSS) that comprise of a system of systems and
one or more new technologies that may trigger its
development. The basic steps of the methodology are shown,
using a running example of a service based on autonomous
vehicles. Starting from the autonomous driving technology, its
impact on the field of local commerce, the value proposition,
business model, and PSS architecture are developed. The
technology impact assessment and PSS concept development
have so far been applied to several PSS projects at Renault.
For future work, the methodology needs to be further
matured via its application to industry case studies. For this
purpose, the methodology is going to be implemented in the
arKItectTM tool. In addition, a promising area of future work is
the representation of the value network that forms the basis for
collaborations between actors.
