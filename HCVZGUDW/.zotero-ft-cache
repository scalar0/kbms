Preface
Complex Analysis has successfully maintained its place as the standard elementary text on functions of one complex variable. There is, nevertheless, need for a new edition, partly because of changes in current mathematical terminology, partly because of differences in student preparedness and aims. There are no radical innovations in the new edition. The author still believes strongly in a geometric approach to the basics, and for this reason the introductory chapters are virtually unchanged. In a few places, throughout the book, it was desirable to clarify certain points that experience has shown to have been a source of possible misunderstanding or difficulties. Misprints and minor errors that have come to my attention have been corrected. Otherwise, the main differences between the second and third editions can be summarized as follows: 1. Notations and terminology have been modernized, but it did not seem necessary to change the style in any significant way. 2. In Chapter 2 a brief section on the change of length and area under conformal mapping has been added. To some degree this infringes on the otherwise self-contained exposition, for it forces the reader to fall back on calculus for the definition and manipulation of double integrals. The disadvantage is minor. 3. In Chapter 4 there is a new and simpler proof of the general form of Cauchy's theorem. It is due to A. F. Beardon, who has kindly permitted me to reproduce it. It complements but does not replace the old proof, which has been retained and improved. 4. A short section on the Riemann zeta function has been included.

xlv PREFACE
This always fascinates students, and the proof of the functional equation illustrates the use of residues in a less trivial situation than the mere computation of definite integrals. 5. Large parts of Chapter 8 have been completely rewritten. The main purpose was to introduce the reader to the terminology of germs and sheaves while emphasizing all the classical concepts. It goes without saying that nothing beyond the basic notions of sheaf theory would have been compatible with the elementary nature of the book. 6. The author has successfully resisted the temptation to include Riemann surfaces as one-dimensional complex manifolds. The book would lose much of its usefulness if it went beyond its purpose of being no more than an introduction to the basic methods and results of complex function theory in the plane. It is my pleasant duty to thank the many who have helped me by pointing out misprints, weaknesses, and errors in the second edition. I am particularly grateful to my colleague Lynn Loomis, who kindly let me share student reaction to a recent course based on my book.

COMPLEX ANALYSIS




1 COMPLEX NUMBERS
1. THE ALGEBRA OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
It is fundamental that real and complex numbers obey the same basic laws of arithmetic. We begin our study of complex function theory by stressing and implementing this analogy.
1.1. Arithmetic Operations. From elementary algebra the reader is acquainted with the imaginary unit i with the property i 2 = -1. If the imaginary unit is combined with two real numbers a, (:3 by the processes of addition and multiplication, we obtain a complex number a+ i(:3. a and (:3 are the real and imaginary part of the complex number. If a = 0, the number is said to be purely imaginary; if (:3 = 0, it is of course real. Zero is the only number which is at once real and purely imaginary. Two complex numbers are equal if and only if they have the same real part and the same imaginary part. Addition and multiplication do not lead out from the system of complex numbers. Assuming that the ordinary rules of arithmetic apply to complex numbers we find indeed
(1) (a + i(:3) + ('Y + ifi) = (a + 'Y) + i((:3 + fi)
and
(2) (a + if3)('Y + ifJ) = (a'Y - (:3fi) + i(afi + f3"f).
In the second identity we have made use of the relation i 2 = -1. It is less obvious that division is also possible. We wish to


2 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
show that (a+ i{3)/('Y + i~) is a complex number, provided that 'Y +
i~ rf 0. If the quotient is denoted by x + iy, we must have
a+ i{3 = ('Y + i~)(x + iy).
By (2) this condition can be written
a+ i{3 = ('YX - ~y) + i(~x + 'YY),
and we obtain the two equations
a = 'YX- ~y {3 = ~X+ 'YYÂ·
This system of simultaneous linear equations has the unique solution
a'Y + {3~
X = -y2 + ~2
f3'Y - a~
y = 'Â¥2 + ~2,
for we know that 'Â¥2 + ~ 2 is not zero. We have thus the result
(3)
Once the existence of the quotient has been proved, its value can be found in a simpler way. If numerator and denominator are multiplied with 'Y - i~, we find at once
a+ i{3 (a+ if3)('Y - i~)
'Y+ i~- = ('Y + i~)('Y - i~) (a'Y + {3~) + i(f3'Y - a~)
'Â¥2 + ~2 .â¢
As a special case the reciprocal of a complex number rf 0 is given by
1 a - i{3
a + i{3 = a 2 + {32â¢
We note that in has only four possible values: 1, i, -1, -i. They correspond to values of n which divided by 4 leave the remainders 0, 1, 2, 3.

and

1.2. Square Roots. We shall now show that the square root of a
complex number can be found explicitly. If the given number is a+ i{3,
we are looking for a number x + iy such that
(x + iy) 2 = a + i{3.
This is equivalent to the system of equations
(4) x2- y2 =a
2xy = {3.
From these equations we obtain
(x2 + y2)2 = (x2 _ y2)2 + 4x2yz = a2 + {32.
Hence we must have
x2 + y2 = va2 + (32,
where the square root is positive or zero. Together with the first equation (4) we find
(5) x2 = t(a + V a2 + (32)
y2 = H- a + V a2 + (32).
Observe that these quantities are positive or zero regardless of the sign of a. The equations (5) yield, in general, two opposite values for x and two for y. But these values cannot be combined arbitrarily, for the second equation (4) is not a consequence of (5). We must therefore be careful to select x and y so that their product has the sign of {3. This leads to the general solution
provided that {3 :;6 0. For {3 = 0 the values are Â± y ; if a ~ 0, Â± i V- a


4 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
if a < 0. It is understood that all square roots of positive numbers are taken with the positive sign. We have found that the square root of any complex number exists and has two opposite values. They coincide only if a+ i{3 = 0. They are real if {3 = 0, a ~ 0 and purely imaginary if {3 = 0, a ~ 0. In other words, except for zero, only positive numbers have real square roots and only negative numbers have purely imaginary square roots. Since both square roots are in general complex, it is not possible to distinguish between the positive and negative square root of a complex number. We could of course distinguish between the upper and lower sign in (6), but this distinction is artificial and should be avoided. The correct way is to treat both square roots in a symmetric manner.

2. Find the four values of .y;=l.
3. Compute y:t and V' -i. 4. Solve the quadratic equation

1.3. Justification. So far our approach to complex numbers has been completely uncritical. We have not questioned the existence of a number
system in which the equation x 2 + 1 = 0 has a solution while all the rules of arithmetic remain in force. We begin by recalling the characteristic properties of the real-number system which we denote by R. In the first place, R is a field. This means that addition and multiplication are defined, satisfying the associative, commutative, and distributive laws. The numbers 0 and 1 are neu
tral elements under addition and multiplication, respectively: a + 0 = a,
a Â· 1 = a for all a. Moreover, the equation of subtraction {3 + x = a
has always a solution, and the equation of division {3x = a has a solution
whenever {3 ~ 0. t One shows by elementary reasoning that the neutral elements and the results of subtraction and division are unique. Also, every field is an integral domain: a{3 = 0 if and only if a = 0 or {3 = 0.
t We assume that the reader has a working knowledge of elementary algebra. Although the above characterization of a field is complete, it obviously does not convey much to a student who is not already at least vaguely familiar with the concept.


COMPLEX NUMBERS 5
These properties are common to all fields. In addition, the field R
has an order relation a < {3 (or {3 > a). It is most easily defined in terms
of the set R+ of positive real numbers: a < {3 if and only if {3 - a e R+. The set R+ is characterized by the following properties: (1) 0 is not a positive number; (2) if a :;6 0 either a or -a is positive; (3) the sum and the product of two positive numbers are positive. From these conditions one derives all the usual rules for manipulation of inequalities. In particular
one finds that every square a 2 is either positive or zero; therefore 1 = l2 is a positive number.
By virtue of the order relation the sums 1, 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1, are all different. Hence R contains the natural numbers, and since it is a field it must contain the subfield formed by all rational numbers. Finally, R satisfies the following completeness condition: every increasing and bounded sequence of real numbers has a limit. Let a 1 < a 2 < a 3 < Â· Â· Â· < an < Â· Â· Â· , and assume the existence of a real number B
such that an < B for all n. Then the completeness condition requires the
existence of a number A = limn--->oo an with the following property: given
any e > 0 there exists a natural number n 0 such that A - e < an < A for all n >no.
Our discussion of the real-number system is incomplete inasmuch as we have not proved the existence and uniqueness (up to isomorphisms) of
a system R with the postulated properties. t The student who is not thoroughly familiar with one of the constructive processes by which real numbers can be introduced should not fail to fill this gap by consulting any textbook in which a full axiomatic treatment of real numbers is given.
The equation x2 + 1 = 0 has no solution in R, for a2 + 1 is always positive. 'Suppose now that a field F can be found which contains Rasa
subfield, and in which the equation x2 + 1 = 0 can be solved. Denote a
solution by i. Then x2 + 1 = (x + i)(x - i), and the equation
x2 + 1 = 0 has exactly two roots in F, i and -i. Let C be the subset of
F consisting of all elements which can be expressed in the form a + i{3
with real a and {3. This representation is unique, for a + i{3 = a' + i{3'
implies a - a' = -i({3 - {3'); hence (a - a') 2 = - ({3 - {3') 2, and this is possible only if a = a', {3 = {3'. The subset Cis a subfield of F. In fact, except for trivi~tl verifications which the reader is asked to carry out, this is exactly what was shown in Sec. 1.1. What is more, the structure of Cis independent of F. For if
F' is another field containing Rand a root i' of the equation x2 + 1 = 0,
tAn isomorphism between two fields is a one-to-one correspondence which preserves sums and products. The word is used quite generally to indicate a correspondence which is one to one and preserves all relations that are considered important in a given connection.


6 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
the corresponding subset C' is formed by all elements a + i'{3. There is
a one-to-one correspondence between C and C' which associates a + i{3
and a + i'{3, and this correspondence is evidently a field isomorphism.
It is thus demonstrated that C and C' are isomorphic. We now define the field of complex numbers to be the subfield C of an arbitrarily given F. We have just seen that the choice of F makes no difference, but we have not yet shown that there exists a field F with the required properties. In order to give our definition a meaning it remains to exhibit a field F which contains R (or a subfield isomorphic with R)
and in which the equation x 2 + 1 = 0 has a root. There are many ways in which such a field can be constructed. The simplest and most direct method is the following: Consider all expressions
of the form a + i{3 where a, {3 are real numbers while the signs + and i are
pure symbols (+ does not indicate addition, and i is not an element of a field). These expressions are elements of a field Fin which addition and multiplication are defined by (1) and (2) (observe the two different mean
ings of the sign +). The elements of the particular form a + iO are seen
to constitute a subfield isomorphic to R, and the element 0 + i1 satisfies
the equation x 2 + 1 = 0; we obtain in fact (0 + i1) 2 = -(1 + iO).
The field F has thus the required properties; moreover, it is identical with the corresponding subfield C, for we can write
a+ i{3 = (a+ iO) + {3(0 + i1).
The existence of the complex-number _field is now proved, and we can go
back to the simpler notation a + i{3 where the + indicates addition in C
and i is a root of the equation x 2 + 1 = 0.
EXERCISES (For students with a background in algebra)
1. Show that the system of all matrices of the special form
combined by matrix addition and matrix multiplication, is isomorphic to the field of complex numbers. 2. Show that the complex-number system can be thought of as the field of all polynomials with real coefficients modulo the irreducible
polynomial x 2 + 1.
1.4. Conjugation, Absolute Value. A complex number can be denoted either by a single letter a, representing an element of the field C, or
in the form a + i{3 with real a and {3. Other standard notations are
z = x + iy,!: = ~ + irJ, w = u + iv, and when used in this connection it


COMPLEX NUMBERS 7
is tacitly understood that x, y, ~' '1), u, v are real numbers. The real and imaginary part of a complex number a will also be denoted by Re a, Im a. In deriving the rules for complex addition and multiplication we used only the fact that i 2 = -1. Since -i has the same property, all rules must remain valid if i is everywhere replaced by -i. Direct verification
shows that this is indeed so. The transformation which replaces a + i{3 by a - i{3 is called complex conjugation, and a - i{3 is the conjugate of a+ i{3. The conjugate of a is denoted by a. A number is real if and only if it is equal to its conjugate. The conjugation is an involutory
transformation: this means that a = a. The formulas
a+a
Rea=-2- , a-a
Ima = ""2i
express the real and imaginary part in terms of the complex number and
its conjugate. By systematic use of the notations a and a it is hence possible to dispense with the use of separate letters for the real and imaginary part. It is more convenient, though, to make free use of both notations. The fundamental property of conjugation is the one already referred to, namely, that
a+b=a+b ab =aÂ· b.
The corresponding property for quotients is a consequence: if ax = b, then ax = b, and hence (bja) = bja. More generally, let R(a,b,c, . . .) stand for any rational operation applied to the complex numbers a, b, c, Then
R(a,b,c, ...) = R(a,b,c, ...).
As an application, consider the equation
If !: is a root of this equation, th~n f is a root of the equation
In particular, if the coefficients are real,!: and fare roots of the same equation, and we have the familiar theorem that the nonreal roots of an equation with real coefficients occur in pairs of conjugate roots.
The product aa = a 2 + {3 2 is always positive or zero. Its nonnegative square root is called the modulus or absolute value of the complex num
ber a; it is denoted by Ia!. The terminology and notation are justified by


8 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
the fact that the modulus of a real number coincides with its numerical value taken with the positive sign. We repeat the definition
aa = Ja\ 2,
where !a! ~ 0, and observe that !a! = !a!. For the absolute value of a product we obtain
and hence
lab! = !a! Â· lbl
since both are ~ 0. In words:
The absolute value of a product is equal to the product of the absohtte values of the factors.
It is clear that this property extends to arbitrary finite products:
!a1a2 Â· Â· Â· an! = !a1! Â· !a2! Â· Â· Â· !aniÂ·
The quotient a/b, b ~ 0, satisfies b(a/b) = a, and hence we have also lbl Â· la/bl = !a!, or
or (7)
The formula for the absolute value of a sum is not as simple. We find
Ia + W = (a+ b)(a +b) = aa + (ab + ba) + bb
Ia + bJ2 = !al 2 + IW + 2 Re ab.
The corresponding formula for the difference is
(7') Ia - bJ2 = !a! 2 + IW - 2 Re ab,
and by addition we obtain the identity
(8) !a + bJ2 + !a - bJ2 = 2(Jal 2+ !b\2).
EXERCISES
1. Verify by calculation that the values of
z

for z = x + iy and z = x - iy are conjugate. 2. Find the absolute values of

COMPLEX NUMBERS 9
3. Prove that Ia- b I

if either Ia! = 1 or lbl = 1. What exception must be made if Ia! = lbl = 1?
4. Find the conditions under which the equation az + bz + c = 0 in one complex unknown has exactly one solution, and compute that solution. 5. Prove Lagrange's identity in the complex form
1.5. Inequalities. We shall now prove some important inequalities which will be of constant use. It is perhaps well to point out that there is no order relation in the complex-number system, and hence all inequalities must be between real numbers. From the definition of the absolute value we deduce the inequalities
(9) -Ia! ~ Re a ~ iai
-Ia! ~ Ima ~ Ia!.
The equality Re a = iai holds if and only if a is real and ~ 0. If (9) is applied to (7), we obtain
Ia + W ~ (Ia! + lbi) 2
and hence
(10) Ia + bl ~ Ia! + lbl.
This is called the triangle inequality for reasons which will emerge later. By induction it can be extended to arbitrary sums:
The absolute value of a sum is at most equal to the sum of the absolute values of the terms.
The reader is well aware of the importance of the estimate (11) in the real case, and we shall find it no less important in the theory of complex numbers. Let us determine all cases of equality in (11). In (10) the equality
holds if and only if aE ~ 0 (it is convenient to let c > 0 indicate that c is real and positive). If b ~ 0 this condition can be written in the form ib\2(ajb) ~ 0, and it is hence equivalent to ajb ~ 0. In the general


10 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
case we proceed as follows: Suppose that equality holds in (11); then
Ja1J + Ja2J + Â· Â· Â· + JanJ = J(ai + a2) + aa + Â· Â· Â· +ani
~ Ja1 + a2j + Jaal + Â· Â· Â· + Jan! ~ Ja1J + ja2j + Â· Â· Â· + Ja,).
Hence Ja1 + a2l = Ja1J + ja2j, and if a2 ~ 0 we conclude that ai/a2 s 0.
But the numbering of the terms is arbitrary; thus the ratio of any two nonzero terms must be positive. Suppose conversely that this condition is fulfilled. Assuming that a1 ~ 0 we obtain
To sum up: the sign of equality holds in (11) if and only if the ratio of any two nonzero terms is positive. By (10) we have also
Jal = J(a- b) + bj ~ Ja- bj + Jbl or
Jal - Jbl ~ Ia - bj.
For the same reason Jbl - Jaj ~ Ja - bj, and these inequalities can be combined to
(12) Ja- bj s llal - Jbjj.
Of course the same estimate can be applied to ja + bj. A special case of (10) is the inequality

2. THE GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
With respect to a given rectangular coordinate system in a plane, the
complex number a = a + i(3 can be represented by the point with coordinates (a,{3). This representation is constantly used, and we shall often speak of the point a as a synonym of the number a. The first coordinate axis (x-axis) takes the name of real axis, and the second coordinate axis (y-axis) is called the imaginary axis. The plane itself is referred to as the complex plane.
The geometric representation derives its usefulness from the vivid mental pictures associated with a geometric language. We take the point of view, however, that all conclusions in analysis should be derived from the properties of real numbers, and not from the axioms of geometry. For this reason we shall use geometry only for descriptive purposes, and not for valid proof, unless the language is so thinly veiled that the analytic interpretation is self-evident. This attitude relieves us from the exigencies of rigor in connection with geometric considerations.
2.1. Geometric Addition and Multiplication. The addition of complex numbers can be visualized as vector addition. To this end we let a complex number be represented not only by a point, but also by a vector pointing from the origin to the point. The number, the point, and the vector will all be denoted by the same letter a. As usual we identify all vectors which can be obtained from each other by parallel displacements. Place a second vector b so that its initial point coincides with the end
point of a. Then a + b is represented by the vector from the initial point of a to the end point of b. To construct the difference b - a we draw both vectors a and b from the same initial point; then b - a points from
the end point of a to the end point of b. Observe that a + band a - b are the diagonals in a parallelogram with the sides a and b (Fig. 1-1). An additional advantage of the vectorrepresentation is that the length of the vector a is equal to [a\. Hence the distance between the points a
and b is Ia - b\. With this interpretation the triangle inequality
[a + bl ~ [al + [b[ and the identity [a + W + Ia - W = 2(\a\ 2 + lb\2)
become familiar geometric theorems.
The point a and its conjugate a lie symmetrically with respect to the real axis. The symmetric point of a with respect to the imaginary axis is


COMPLEX NUMBERS 13
FIG. 1-1. Vector addition.
-a. The four points a, -a, -a, a are the vertices of a rectangle which is symmetric with respect to both axes. In order to derive a geometric interpretation of the product of two complex numbers we introduce polar coordinates. If the polar coordinates of the point (a,{3) are (r,tp), we know that
a = r cos tp (3 = r sin if'Â·
Hence we can write a = a + i(3 = r(cos tp + i sin tp). In this trigonometric form of a complex number r is always ~ 0 and equal to the modulus ial. The polar angle if' is called the argument or amplitude of the complex number, and we denote it by arg a. Consider two complex numbers a1 = r 1(cos tp1 + i sin tp1) and
a2 = r2(cos 1P2 + i sin tp2). Their product can be written in the from a1a2 = r1r2[(cos if't cos 1P2 -sin if't sin IP2) + i(sin if't cos 1P2 +cos IPt sin tp2)]. By means of the addition theorems of the cosine and the sine this expression can be simplified to
(16)
We recognize that the product has the modulus r 1r2 and the argument if't + IP2Â· The latter result is new, and we express it through the equation
(17)
It is clear that this formula can be extended to arbitrary products, and we can therefore state:
The argument of a product is equal to the sum of the arguments of the factors.
This is fundamental. The rule that we have just formulated gives a deep and unexpected justification of the geometric representation of complex numbers. We must be fully aware, however, that the manner in which we have arrived at the formula (17) violates our principles. In the


14 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
first place the equation (17) is between angles rather than between numbers, and secondly its proof rested on the use of trigonometry. Thus it remains to define the argument in analytic terms and to prove (17) by purely analytic means. For the moment we postpone this proof and shall be content to discuss the consequences of (17) from a less critical standpoint. We remark first that the argument of 0 is not defined, and hence (17) has a meaning only if a1 and a2 are ~ 0. Secondly, the polar angle is determined only up to multiples of 360Â°. For this reason, if we want to interpret (17) numerically, we must agree that multiples of 360Â° shall not count. By means of (17) a simple geometric construction of the product a1a2 can be obtained. It follows indeed that the triangle with the vertices 0, 1, a1 is similar to the triangle whose vertices are 0, a2, a1a2. The points 0, 1, a1, and a2 being given, this similarity determines the point a1a2 (Fig. 1-2).In the case of division (17) is replaced by
(18)
The geometric construction is the same, except that the similar triangles are now 0, 1, a1 and 0, ada1, a2.
Remark: A perfectly acceptable way to define angles and arguments would be to apply the familiar methods of calculus which permit us to express the length of a circular arc as a definite integral. This leads to a correct definition of the trigonometric functions, and to a computational proof of the addition theorems. The reason we do not follow this path is that complex analysis, as
FIG. 1-2. Vector multiplication.


COMPLEX NUMBERS 15
opposed to real analysis, offers a much more direct approach. The clue lies in a direct connection between the exponential function and the trigonometric functions, to be derived in Chap. 2, Sec. 5. Until we reach this point the reader is asked to subdue his quest for complete rigor.
EXERCISES
1. Find the symmetric points of a with respect to the lines which bisect the angles between the coordinate axes. 2. Prove that the points a1, a2, a3 are vertices of an equilateral triangle

3. Suppose that a and b are two vertices of a square. Find the two other vertices in all possible cases. 4. Find the center and the radius of the circle which circumscribes the triangle with vertices a1, a2, a3. Express the result in symmetric form.
2.2. The Binomial Equation. From the preceding results we derive
that the powers of a = r(cos cp + i sin cp) are given by
(19) an = rn(cos ncp + i sin ncp).
This formula is trivially valid for n = 0, and since
a- 1 = r- 1(cos cp- isin cp) = r- 1[cos (-cp) + isin (-cp)]
it holds also when n is a negative integer.
For r = 1 we obtain de M oivre' s formula
(20) (cos cp + i sin cp)n = cos ncp + i sin ncp
which provides an extremely simple way to express cos ncp and sin ncp in terms of cos cp and sin cp. To find the nth root of a complex number a we have to solve the equation
(21) zn =a.
Supposing that a ~ 0 we write a = r(cos cp + i sin cp) and
z = p(cos 0 + i sin 0).
Then (21) takes the form
(22) pn(cos nO+ i sin nO) = r'(cos cp + i sin cp).


16 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
This equation is certainly fulfilled if p"' = r and nO = q;. Hence we obtain the root
_n;: ( ip â¢ â¢ ip)
z = v 1 cos n+ ~ sm n '
where -\lr denotes the positive nth root of the positive number r. But this is not the only solution. In fact, (22) is also fulfilled if nO differs from q; by a multiple of the full angle. If angles are expressed in radians the full angle is 2?r, and we find that (22) is satisfied if and only if
(J = p_ + k . 2?r,
nn
where k is any integer. However, only the values k = 0, 1, . . . , n - 1 give different values of z. Hence the complete solution of the equation (21) is given by
z = -\lr [cos(~+ k ~") + i sin(~+ k ~)} k = o, 1, ... , n- 1.
There are n nth roots of any complex number ~ 0. They have the same modulus, and their arguments are equally spaced.
Geometrically, the nth roots are the vertices of a regular polygon with n sides. The case a = 1 is particularly important. The roots of the equation zn = 1 are called nth roots of unity, and if we set

all the roots can be expressed by 1, w, w2, ..â¢ , wn-l. It is also quite

2.3. Analytic Geometry. In classical analytic geometry the equation of a locus is expressed as a relation between x andy. It can just as well
be expressed in terms of z and z, sometimes to distinct advantage. The thing to remember is that a complex equation is ordinarily equivalent to two real equations; in order to obtain a genuine locus these equations should be essentially the same. For instance, the equation of a circle is lz - al = r. In algebraic form it can be rewritten as (z - a)(z - a) = r2â¢ The fact that this equation is invariant under complex conjugation is an indication that it represents a single real equation. A straight line in the complex plane can be given by a parametric equation z = a+ bt, where a and bare complex numbers and b ~ 0; the
parameter t runs through all real values. Two equations z = a + bt and
z = a' + b't represent the same line if and only if a' - a and b' are real multiples of b. The lines are parallel whenever b' is a real multiple of b, and they are equally directed if b' is a positive multiple of b. The direction of a directed line can be identified with arg b. The angle between
z = a + bt and z = a' + b't is arg b' jb; observe that it depends on the order in which the lines are named. The lines are orthogonal to each other if b'/b is purely imaginary. Problems of finding intersections between lines and circles, parallel or orthogonal lines, tangents, and the like usually become exceedingly simple when expressed in complex form. An inequality lz - al < r describes the inside of a circle. Similarly,
a directed line z = a + bt determines a right half plane consisting of all
points z with Im (z - a) jb < 0 and a left half plane with Im (z - a) /b > 0. An easy argument shows that this distinction is independent of the parametric representation.

18 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
2.4. The Spherical Representation. For many purposes it is useful to extend the system C of complex numbers by introduction of a symbol co to represent infinity. Its connection with the finite numbers is estab
lished by setting a + co = co + a = co for all finite a, and
bÂ· co= co Â·b =co
for all b ~ 0, including b = co. It is impossible, however, to define
co + co and 0 Â· co without violating the laws of arithmetic. By special convention we shall nevertheless write ajO = co for a ~ 0 and b/ co = 0 for b ~ co. In the plane there is no room for a point corresponding to co, but we can of course introduce an "ideal" point which we call the point at infinity. The points in the plane together with the point at infinity form the extended complex plane. We agree that every straight line shall pass through the point at infinity. By contrast, no half plane shall contain the ideal point. It is desirable to introduce a geometric model in which all points of rhe extended plane have a concrete representative. To this end we consider the unit sphere S whose equation in three-dimensional space is
xi + x~ + x~ = 1. With every point on S, except (0,0,1), we can associate a complex number
(24) Xt + ix2
z= '
1 - Xa
and this correspondence is one to one. Indeed, from (24) we obtain
2+ 2 1+
\z\2 = ~~ = __x_a,
(1 - xa) 2 1 - Xa and hence
(25)
Further computation yields
(26)
Xa =
Xt = z+z
1 + \z\ 2
z- z
X2 = i(1 + \z\2).
The correspondence can be completed by letting the point at infinity correspond to (0,0,1), and we can thus regard the sphere as a representation of the extended plane or of the extended number system. We
note that the hemisphere x3 < 0 corresponds to the disk \z\ < 1 and the


COMPLEX NUMBERS 19
hemisphere x 3 > 0 to its outside \z\ > 1. In function theory the sphere S is referred to as the Riemann sphere. If the complex plane is identified with the (x1,x2)-plane with the xr and x 2-axis corresponding to the real and imaginary axis, respectively, the transformation (24) takes on a simple geometric meaning. Writing
z = x + iy we can verify that
(27)
and this means that the points (x,y,O) (x1,x2,xa), and (0,0,1) are in a straight line. Hence the correspondence is a central projection from the center (0,0,1) as shown in Fig. 1-3. It is called a stereographic projection. The context will make it clear whether the stereographic projection is regarded as a mapping from S to the extended complex plane, or vice versa. In the spherical representation there is no simple interpretation of addition and multiplication. Its advantage lies in the fact that the point at infinity is no longer distinguished. It is geometrically evident that the stereographic projection transforms every straight line in the z-plane into a circle on S which passes through the pole (0,0,1), and the converse is also true. More generally, any circle on the sphere corresponds to a circle or straight line in the z-plane. To prove this we observe that a circle on the sphere lies in a plane
a1x1 + a2X2 + aaxa = ao, where we can assume that ai + a~ + a~ = 1
and 0 ~ a0 < 1. In terms of z and z this equation takes the form
or
For ao ~ aa this is the equation of a circle, and for ao = aa it represents a straight line. Conversely, the equation of any circle or straight line
FIG. 1-3. Stereographic projection.


20 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
can be written in this form. The correspondence is consequently one to one. It is easy to calculate the distance d(z,z') between the stereographic projections of z and z'. If the points on the sphere are denoted by (x1,x2,x3), (xf,x~,xD, we have first
(x1 - xD 2 + (x2 - x~) 2 + (xg - x~) 2 = 2 - 2(xlx; + X2X~ + XgX~).
From (35) and (36) we obtain after a short computation
X1X; + X2X~ + XgX~
(z + z)(z' + z')- (z- z)(z'- z') + (lzl 2 -1)(1z'l 2 -1)

2 COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
1. INTRODUCTION TO THE CONCEPT OF ANALYTIC FUNCTION
The theory of functions of a complex variable aims at extending calculus to the complex domain. Both differentiation and integration acquire new depth and significance; at the same time the range of applicability becomes radically restricted. Indeed, only the analytic or holomorphic functions can be freely differentiated and integrated. They are the only true "functions" in the sense of the French "Theorie des fonctions" or the German ''Funktionentheorie.'' Nevertheless, we shall use the term "function" in its modern meaning. Therefore, when stepping up to complex numbers we have to consider four different kinds of functions: real functions of a real variable, real functions of a complex variable, complex functions of a real variable, and complex functions of a complex variable. As a practical matter we agree that the letters z and w shall always denote complex variables; thus, to indicate a complex
function of a complex variable we use the notation w = f(z). t
The notation y = f(x) will be used in a neutral manner with the understanding that x andy can be either real or complex. When we want to indicate that a variable is definitely restricted to real values, we shall usually denote it by t. By these agreements we
t Modern students are well aware that f stands for the function and f(z) for a value of the function. However, analysts are traditionally minded and continue to speak of "the function f(z)." 21


22 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
do not wish to cancel the earlier convention whereby a notation z = x + iy automatically implies that x and y are real. It is essential that the law by which a function is defined be formulated in clear and unambiguous terms. In other words, all functions must be
well defined and consequently, until further notice, single-valued. t
It is not necessary that a function be defined for all values of the independent variable. For the moment we shall deliberately underemphasize the role of point set theory. Therefore we make merely an informal agreement that every function be defined on an open set, by which we mean that if f(a) is defined, then f(x) is defined for all x sufficiently close to a. The formal treatment of point set topology is deferred until the next chapter.
1.1. Limits and Continuity. The following basic definition will be adopted:
Definition 1. The function f(x) is said to have the limit A as x tends to a,
(1) lim f(x) = A,
x->a
if and only if the following is true:
For every 5 > 0 there exists a number o> 0 with the property that
\f(x) - A\ < 5 for all values of x such that \x - a\ < oand x :r!i a.
This definition makes decisive use of the absolute value. Since the notion of absolute value has a meaning for complex as well as for real numbers, we can use the same definition regardless of whether the variable x and the function f(x) are real or complex. As an alternative simpler notation we sometimes write: f(x)-+ A for x-+ a.
There are some familiar variants of the definition which correspond to the case where a or A is infinite. In the real case we can distinguish
between the limits + oo and - oo, but in the complex case there is only one infinite limit. We trust the reader to formulate correct definitions to cover all the possibilities. The well-known results concerning the limit of a sum, a product, and a quotient continue to hold in the complex case. Indeed, the proofs depend only on the properties of the absolute value expressed by
Jab\ = \a\ Â· \b\ and \a + b\ ~ \a\ + \b\.
t We shall sometimes use the pleonastic term single-valued function to underline that the function has only one value for each value of the variable.


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 23
Condition (1) is evidently equivalent to
(2) lim f(x) = A.
x~a
From (1) and (2) we obtain
lim Re f(x) = ReA
x~a
(3) lim Im f(x) = Im A.
x~a
Conversely, (1) is a consequence of (3). The function f(x) is said to be continuous at a if and only if lim f(x) = f(a). A continuous function, without further qualification,
~a
is one which is continuous at all points where it is defined.
The sumf(x) + g(x) and the productf(x)g(x) of two continuous functions are continuous; the quotient f(x)jg(x) is defined and continuous at a if and only if g(a) ~ 0. If f(x) is continuous, so are Re f(x), Im f(x), and \f(x)\.
The derivative of a function is defined as a particular limit and can be considered regardless of whether the variables are real or complex. The formal definition is
(4) f'(a) = lim f(x) - f(a).
~a X - a
The usual rules for forming the derivative of a sum, a product, or a quotient are all valid. The derivative of a composite function is determined by the chain rule. There is nevertheless a fundamental difference between the cases of a real and a complex independent variable. To illustrate our point, let f(z) be a real function of a complex variable whose derivative exists at z = a. Then f'(a) is on one side real, for it is the limit of the quotients
f(a + h) - f(a) h
as h tends to zero through real values. On the other side it is also the limit of the quotients
f(a + ih) - f(a) ih
and as such purely imaginary. Therefore f'(a) must be zero. Thus a real function of a complex variable either has the derivative zero, or else the derivative does not exist.


24 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
The case of a complex function of a real variable can be reduced to the
real case. If we write z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) we find indeed
z'(t) = x'(t) + iy'(t),
and the existence of z'(t) is equivalent to the simultaneous existence of x'(t) and y'(t). The complex notation has nevertheless certain formal advantages which it would be unwise to give up. In contrast, the existence of the derivative of a complex function of a complex variable has far-reaching consequences for the structural properties of the function. The investigation of these consequences is the central theme in complex-function theory.
1.2. Analytic Functions. The class of analytic functions is formed by the complex functions of a complex variable which possess a derivative wherever the function is defined. The term holomorphic function is used with identical meaning. For the purpose of this preliminary investigation the reader may think primarily of functions which are defined in the whole plane. The sum and the product of two analytic functions are again analytic. The same is true of the quotient f(z)fg(z) of two analytic functions, provided that g(z) does not vanish. In the general case it is necessary to exclude the points at which g(z) = 0. Strictly speaking, this very typical case will thus not be included in our considerations, but it will be clear that the results remain valid except for obvious modifications. The definition of the derivative can be rewritten in the form
f'(z) = lim f(z + h) - f(z).
h--->0 h
As a first consequence f(z) is necessarily continuous. Indeed, from f(z + h) - f(z) = h Â· (f(z +h) - f(z))/h we obtain
lim (f(z +h) - f(z)) = 0 Â· f'(z) = 0.
h---+0
If we write f(z) = u(z) + iv(z) it follows, moreover, that u(z) and v(z) are both continuous. The limit of the difference quotient must be the same regardless of the way in which h approaches zero. If we choose real values for h, then the imaginary part y is kept constant, and the derivative becomes a partial derivative with respect to x. We have thus
f'(z) = of = au + i av.

COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 25
Similarly, if we substitute purely imaginary values ik for h, we obtain
f'(z) = lim f(z + i~) - f(z) -= -i aj = -i au + av.

It follows that j(z) must satisfy the partial differential equation
(5) aj = - i aj

which resolves into the real equations
(6) au av

au av ay = ax
These are the Cauchy-Riemann differential equations which must be
satisfied by the real and imaginary part of any analytic function. t We remark that the existence of the four partial derivatives in (6) is implied by the existence of f'(z). Using (6) we can write down four
formally different expressions for f' (z); the simplest is
f '( ) _ Bu + .av

For the quantity \f'(z)l2 we have, for instance,
\J'(z)\2 = (au)2 + (~~)2 = (au)2 + (av)2 = au av au av
ax ay ax ax ax ay - ay axÂ·
The last expression shows that \J'(z)\ 2 is the Jacobian of u and v with respect to x and y. We shall prove later that the derivative of an analytic function is itself analytic. By this fact u and v will have continuous partial derivatives of all orders, and in particular the mixed derivatives will be equal. Using this information we obtain from (6)

A function u which satisfies Laplace's equation Au = 0 is said to be harmonic. The real and imaginary part of an analytic function are thus harmonic. If two harmonic functions u and v satisfy the CauchyRiemann equations (6), then v is said to be the conjugate harmonic func

26 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
tion of u. Actually, v is determined only up to an additive constant, so that the use of the definite article, although traditional, is not quite accurate. In the same sense, u is the conjugate harmonic function of -v. This is not the place to discuss the weakest conditions of regularity which can be imposed on harmonic functions. We wish to prove, how
ever, that the function u + iv determined by a pair of conjugate harmonic functions is always analytic, and for this purpose we make the explicit assumption that u and v have continuous first-order partial derivatives. It is proved in calculus, under exactly these regularity conditions, that we can write
au au
u(x + h,y + k) - u(x,y) = ax h + ay k + 51
av av
v(x + h,y + k) - v(x,y) = ax h + ay k + 52,
where the remainders 51, 52 tend to zero more rapidly than h + ik in the
sense that 51/(h + ik)----? 0 and 52/(h + ik)----? 0 for h + ik----? 0. With
the notation f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) we obtain by virtue of the relations (6)
f(z + h + ik) - f(z) = (~~ + i ~~) (h + ik) +51+ i52
and hence
lim f(z + h + ik) - f(z) = au + i av.
h+ilc--->0 h + ik ax ax
We conclude that f(z) is analytic.
If u(x,y) and v(x,y) have continuous first-order partial derivatives which
satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann differential equations, then f(z) = u(z) + iv(z) is analytic with continuous derivative f'(z), and conversely.
The conjugate of a harmonic function can be found by integration, and in simple cases the computation can be made explicit. For instance, u = x 2 - y 2 is harmonic and aujax = 2x, aujay = -2y. The conjugate function must therefore satisfy
aavx= 2Y, aavy = 2x.
From the first equation v = 2xy + q;(y), where q;(y) is a function of y
alone. Substitution in the second equation yields q;'(y) = 0. Hence q;(y) is a constant, and the most general conjugate function of x 2 - y 2 is

analytic function with the real part x2 - y 2 is hence z2 + ic.


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 27
There is an interesting formal procedure which throws considerable light on the nature of analytic functions. We present this procedure with an explicit warning to the reader that it is purely formal and does not possess any power of proof. Consider a complex functionf(x,y) of two real variables. Introducing
the complex variable z = x + iy and its conjugate z = x - iy, we can
write x = i(z + z), y = -ti(z - z). With this change of variable we
can consider f(x,y) as a function of z and z which we will treat as independent variables (forgetting that they are in fact conjugate to each other). If the rules of calculus were applicable, we would obtain
These expressions have no convenient definition as limits, but we can nevertheless introduce them as symbolic derivatives with respect to z
and z. By comparison with (5) we find that analytic functions are char
acterized by the condition ajjaz = 0. We are thus tempted to say that
an analytic function is independent of z, and a function of z alone. This formal reasoning supports the point of view that analytic functions are true functions of a complex variable as opposed to functions which are more adequately described as complex functions of two real variables. By similar formal arguments we can derive a very simple method which allows us to compute, without use of integration, the analytic function f(z) whose real part is a given harmonic function u(x,y). We remark first that the conjugate function f(z) has the derivative zero with respect to z and may, therefore, be considered as a function of z; we denote this function by J(z). With this notation we can write down the identity
u(x,y) = t[f(x + iy) + j(x - iy)].
It is reasonable to expect that this is a formal identity, and then it holds even when x and y are complex. If we substitute x = z/2, y = z/2i, we obtain
u(z/2, z/2i) = t[f(z) + J(O)].
Since f(z) is only determined up to a purely imaginary constant, we may as well assume that f(O) is real, which implies .f(O) = u(O,O). The function f(z) can thus be computed by means of the formula
f(z) = 2u(z/2, z/2i) Â·- u(O,O).
A purely imaginary constant can be added at will. In this form the method is definitely limited to functions u(x,y) which


28 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
are rational in x and y, for the function must have a meaning for complex values of the argument. Suffice it to say that the method can be extended to the general case and that a complete justification can be given.

1.3. Polynomials. Every constant is an analytic function with the derivative 0. The simplest nonconstant analytic function is z whose derivative is 1. Since the sum and product of two analytic functions are again analytic, it follows that every polynomial
(7) P(z) = ao + a1z + Â· Â· Â· + anZ" is an analytic function. Its derivative is
P'(z) = a1 + 2a2z + Â· Â· Â· + nanzn-1.
The notation (7) shall imply that an ~ 0, and the polynomial is then said to be of degree n. The constant 0, considered as a polynomial, is in
many respects exceptional and will be excluded from our considerations. t
For n > 0 the equation P(z) = 0 has at least one root. This is the so-called fundamental theorem of algebra which we shall prove later. If P(a1) = 0, it is shown in elementary algebra tb.at P(z) = (z - a1)P1(z) where P1(z) is a polynomial of degree n - 1. Repetition of this process finally leads to a complete factorization
(8) P(z) = an(z - a1) (z - a2) Â· Â· Â· (z - an)
t For formal reasons, if the constant 0 is regarded as a polynomial, its degree is set equal to - ""Â·


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 29
where the a 1, a2, . . . , an are not necessarily distinct. From the factorization we conclude that P(z) does not vanish for any value of z different from a 1, a2, . . . , an. Moreover, the factorization is uniquely determined except for the order of the factors. If exactly h of the ai coincide, their common value is called a zero of P(z) of the order h. We find that the sum of the orders of the zeros of a polynomial is equal to its degree. More simply, if each zero is counted as many times as its order indicates, a polynomial of degree n has exactly n zeros. The order of a zero a can also be determined by consideration of the successive derivatives of P(z) for z = a. Suppose that a is a zero of
order h. Then we can write P(z) = (z - a)"Ph(z) with Ph(a) ~ 0. Successive derivation yields P(a) = P'(a) = Â· Â· Â· = p<h-ll(a) = 0 while p<hJ(a) ~ 0. In other words, the order of a zero equals the order of the first nonvanishing derivative. A zero of order 1 is called a simple zero and is characterized by the conditions P(a) = 0, P'(a) ~ 0. As an application we shall prove the following theorem, known as Lucas's theorem:
Theorem I. If all zeros of a polynomial P(z) lie in a half plane, then all zeros of the derivative P' (z) lie in the same half plane.
(9)
From (8) we obtain
P'(z) = _1_ + ... +-1-Â·
P(z) z - a1 Z - an
Suppose that the half plane H is defined as the part of the plane where
Im (z - a)/b < 0 (see Chap. 1, Sec. 2.3). If ak is in H and z is not, we have then
z - ak z - a ak - a
Im-b- = Im-b-- Im-b- > 0.
But the imaginary parts of reciprocal numbers have opposite sign. Therefore, under the same assumption, Im b(z - ak)- 1 < 0. If this is true for all k we conclude from (9) that
Im b;(';z)) = i Im _b_ < 0,
k=l z - ak
and consequently P' (z) ~ 0. In a sharper formulation the theorem tells us that the smallest convex polygon that contains the zeros of P(z) also contains the zeros of P'(z).


30 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
1.4. Rational Functions. We turn to the case of a rational function
(10) P(z)
R(z) = Q(z)'
given as the quotient of two polynomials. We assume, and this is essential, that P(z) and Q(z) have no common factors and hence no common zeros. R(z) will be given the value ao at the zeros of Q(z). It must therefore be considered as a function with values in the extended plane, and as such it is continuous. The zeros of Q(z) are called poles of R(z), and the order of a pole is by definition equal to the order of the corresponding zero of Q(z). The derivative
(11) R'() = P'(z)Q(z) - Q'(z)P(z)
z Q(z)2
exists only when Q(z) ~ 0. However, as a rational function defined by the right-hand member of (11), R'(z) has the same poles as R(z), the order of each pole being increased by one. In case Q(z) has multiple zeros, it should be noticed that the expression (11) does not appear in reduced form. Greater unity is achieved if we let the variable z as well as the values R(z) range over the extended plane. We may defineR( ao) as the limit of R(z) as z ----7 ao, but this definition would not determine the order of a zero or pole at ao. It is therefore preferable to consider the function R(l/z), which we can rewrite as a rational function Rt(z), and set
R( ao) = Rt(O).
If R 1(0) = 0 or ao, the order of the zero or pole at ao is defined as the order of the zero or pole of R 1(z) at the origin. With the notation
R(z)
we obtain
ao + alz + . . . + anzn
bo + b1z + Â· Â· Â· + bmZ"'
_ aozn + a1zn-I + Â· Â· Â· + an
Rt(Z) = zm n ,-::...---'--,,--::.-----,,------:-_ _ __:_=-"
bozm + blzm-l + Â· Â· Â· + bm
where the power zm-n belongs either to the numerator or to the denomi
nator. Accordingly, if m > n R(z) has a zero of order m - n at ao, if m < n the point at ao is a pole of order n - m, and if m = n


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 31
We can now count the total nurnber of zeros and poles in the extended plane. The count shows that the number of zeros, including those at ao, is equal to the greater of the numbers m and n. The number of poles is the same. This common number of zeros and poles is called the order of the rational function. If a is any constant, the function R(z) - a has the same poles as R(z), and consequently the same order. The zeros of R(z) - a are roots of
the equation R(z) = a, and if the roots are counted as many times as the order of the zero indicates, we can state the following result:
A rational function R(z) of order p has p zeros and p poles, and every
equation R(z) = a has exactly p roots.
A rational function of order 1 is a linear fraction
S(z) = az + {3
"/Z + (j
with all - f3'Y ~ 0. Such fractions, or linear transformations, will be studied at length in Chap. 3, Sec. 3. For the moment we note merely that the equation w = S(z) has exactly one root, and we find indeed
ow- {3
z = S- 1(w) = Â·
-'YW +a
The transformations S and S-1 are inverse to each other.
The linear transformation z + a is called a parallel translation, and 1/z is an inversion. The former has a fixed point at co, the latter interchanges 0 and ao . Every rational function has a representation by partial fractions. In order to derive this representation we assume first that R(z) has a pole at ao. We carry out the division of P(z) by Q(z) until the degree of the remainder is at most equal to that of the denominator. The result can be written in the form
(12) R(z) = G(z) + H(z)
where G(z) is a polynomial without constant term, and H(z) is finite at ao. The degree of G(z) is the order of the pole at ao, and the polynomial G(z) is called the singular part of R(z) at ao. Let the distinct finite poles of R(z) be denoted by {31, {32, â¢â¢â¢ , {3q.
The function R ({3i + I) is a rational function of ~ with a pole at ~ = ao.
By use of the decomposition (12) we can write


32 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
or with a change of variable
R(z) = G; ( -1- ) + H; ( -1- ) Â·
z - {3; z - {3;
Here G; (z ~ 13) is a polynomial in z~ {3; without constant term, called
the singular part of R(z) at (3;. The function H; (z ~ 13) is finite for
z = {3;.
Consider now the expression
(13) R(z) - G(z) - f G; ( -1- ) Â·
L z- {3Â·
i=l 1
This is a rational function which cannot have other poles than {31, {32,
â¢â¢â¢ , {3q and ao. At z = {31 we find that the two terms which become
infinite have a difference H; (z ~ {3;) with a finite limit, and the same
is true at ao. Therefore (13) has neither any finite poles nor a pole at ao. A rational function without poles must reduce to a constant, and if this constant is absorbed in G(z) we obtain
(14) R(z) = G(z) + itl G; (z ~ 13)
This representation is well known from the calculus where it is used as a technical device in integration theory. However, it is only with the introduction of complex numbers that it becomes completely successful.

2. ELEMENTARY THEORY OF POWER SERIES
Polynomials and rational functions are very special analytic functions. The easiest way to achieve greater variety is to form limits. For instance, the sum of a convergent series is such a limit. If the terms are functions of a variable, so is the sum, and if the terms are analytic functions, chances are good that the sum will also be analytic. Of all series with analytic terms the power series with complex coefficients are the simplest. In this section we study only the most elementary properties of power series. A strong motivation for taking up this study when we are not yet equipped to prove the most general properties (those that depend on integration) is that we need power series to construct the exponential function (Sec. 3).
2.1. Sequences. The sequence {an}i' has the limit A if to every E > 0
there exists an no such that )an - Aj < E for n ~ no. A sequence with a finite limit is said to be convergent, and any sequence which does not converge is divergent. If limn--.oo an = ao, the sequence may be said to diverge to infinity.
Only in rare cases can the convergence be proved by exlllbiting the limit, so it is extremely important to make use of a method that permits proof of the existence of a limit even when it cannot be determined explicitly. The test that serves this purpose bears the name of Cauchy. A sequence will be called fundamental, or a Cauchy sequence, if it satisfies the follow
ing condition: given any E > 0 there exists an no such that Jan - ami < E whenever n ~ no and m ~ no. The test reads:
A sequence is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
The necessity is immediate. If an ----7 A we can find no such that Jan - Aj < e/2 for n ~ n 0â¢ For m,n ~ no it follows by the triangle
inequality that Jan - ami ~ Jan - AI + lam - AI < E. The sufficiency is closely connected with the definition of real numbers, and one way in which real numbers can be introduced is indeed to postulate the sufficiency of Cauchy's condition. However, we wish to use only the property that every bounded monotone sequence of real num~ hers has a limit.


34 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
The real and imaginary parts of a Cauchy sequence are again Cauchy sequences, and if they converge, so does the original sequence. For this reason we need to prove the sufficiency only for real sequences. We use the opportunity to recall the notions of limes superior and limes inferior. Given a real sequence {an} i' we shall set an = max {at, . . . , an}, that
is, a,. is the greatest of the numbers at, . . . , an. The sequence {an} i' is
nondecreasing; hence it has a limit At which is finite or equal to + oo. The number At is known as the least upper bound or supremum (l.u.b. or sup) of the numbers an; indeed, it is the least number which is ~ all anÂ· Construct in the same way the least upper bound Ak of the sequence {an} k' obtained from the original sequence by deleting at, . . . , ak-tÂ· It is clear that {Ak} is a nonincreasing sequence, and we denote its limit
by A. It may be finite, + oo, or - oo. In any case we write
A = lim sup an.
n->oo
It is easy to characterize the limes superior by its properties. If A is
finite and c > 0 there exists an no such that An, < A + E, and it follows
that an ~ An, < A + E for n ~ no. In the opposite direction, if an ~ A - c for n ~ no, then An, ~ A - E, which is impossible. In
other words, there are arbitrarily large n for which an > A - c. If
A = + oo there are arbitrarily large an, and A = - oo if and only if a,. tends to - oo. In all cases there cannot be more than one number A with these properties. The limes inferior can be defined in the same manner with inequalities reversed. It is quite clear that the limes inferior and limes superior will be equal if and only if the sequence converges to a finite limit or diverges
to + oo or to - oo. The notations are frequently simplified to lim and lim. The reader should prove the following relations:
lim an + lim f3n ~ lim (an + f3n) ~ lim an + lim f3n
lim an + lim f3n ~ lim (an + f3n) ~ lim an + lim f3n.
Now we return to the sufficiency of Cauchy's condition. From
\an - an,\ < Ewe obtain lan\ < \an,l + c for n s no, and it follows that A = lim an and a = lim an are both finite. If a~ A choose
(A- a)
c= 3
and determine a corresponding no. By definition of a and A there exists
an an < a + c and an am > A - c with m,n ~ no. It follows that
A - a = (A - am) + (am - an) + (a,. - a) < 3c, contrary to the choice
of c. Hence a = A, and the sequence converges.


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 35
2.2. Series. A very simple application of Cauchy's condition permits us to deduce the convergence of one sequence from that of another. If it
is true that \bm - b,.\ ~ \am - a,.\ for all pairs of subscripts, the sequence
{b,.} may be termed a contraction of the sequence {an} (this is not a standard term). Under this condition, if {a,.} is a Cauchy sequence, so is {bn }. Hence convergence of {a,.} implies convergence of {b,.}. An infinite series is a formal infinite sum
(15)
Associated with this series is the sequence of its partial sums
The series is said to converge if and only if the corresponding sequence is convergent, and if this is the case the limit of the sequence is the sum of the series. Applied to a series Cauchy's convergence test yields the following
condition: The series (15) converges if and only if to every e > 0 there
exists an no such that \an + an+t + Â· Â· Â· + an+P\ < c for all n ~ no and
p ~ 0. For p = 0 we find in particular that \a,.\ < e. Hence the general term of a convergent series tends to zero. This condition is necessary, but of course not sufficient. If a finite number of the terms of the series (15) are omitted, the new series converges or diverges together with (15). In the case of convergence, let Rn be the sum of the series which begins with the term a,.+lÂ·
Then the sum of the whole series is S = Sn + Rn. The series (15) can be compared with the series
(16)
formed by the absolute values of the terms. The sequence of partial sums of (15) is a contraction of the sequence corresponding to (16), for
\an + an+l + Â· Â· Â· + an+p\ ~ \a,.\ + \an+J\ + Â· Â· Â· + \a,.+P\Â· There
fore, convergence of (16) implies that the original series (15) is convergent. A series with the property that the series formed by the absolute values of the terms converges is said to be absolutely convergent.
2.3. Uniform Convergence. Consider a sequence of functions f,.(x), all defined on the same set E. If the sequence of values {.f,.(x)} converges for every x that belongs toE, then the limitf(x) is again a function
on E. By definition, if c > 0 and x belongs to E there exists an no such
that lf,.(x) - f(x)\ < c for n ~ no, but no is allowed to depend on x.


36 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
For instance, it is true that
lim (1 + ~) X = X
n~oo n
for all x, but. in order to have 1(1 + 1/n)x - xl = !xl/n < c for n ~ no
it is necessary that no > lxl/c. Such an no exists for every fixed x, but the requirement cannot be met simultaneously for all x. We say in this situation that the sequence converges pointwise, but not uniformly. In positive formulation: The sequence {fn(x)} converges uniformly to f(x) on the set E if to every c > 0 there exists an n~ such that lfn(x)- f(x)l <~;for all n ~no and all x in E.
The most important consequence of uniform convergence is the following:
The limit function of a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions is itself continuous.
Suppose that the functions fn(x) are continuous and tend uniformly
to f(x) on the set E. For any c > 0 we are able to find ann such that
!fn(x) - f(x)i < c/3 for all x in E. Let Xo be a point in E. Becausefn(x)
is continuous at Xo we can find o > 0 such that !fn(x) - fn(Xo) I < e/3 for all
x in E with !x - x 0! < o. Under the same condition on x it follows that
!f(x) - f(xo)l ~ lf(x) - fn(x)! + lf,.(x) - fn(Xo)! + lfn(Xo) - f(xo)! < e,
and we have proved that f(x) is continuous at xo. In the theory of analytic functions we shall find uniform convergence much more important than pointwise convergence. However, in most cases it will be found that the convergence is uniform only on a part of the set on which the functions are originally defined. Cauchy's necessary and sufficient condition has a counterpart for uniform convergence. We assert:
The sequence lfn(x)} converges uniformly on E if and only if to every
<. > 0 there exists an no such that !fm(x) - fn(x) I < efor all m,n ~ no and all xin E.
The necessity is again trivial. For the sufficiency we remark that the limit function f(x) exists by the ordinary form of Cauchy's test. In the inequality !fm(x) - fn(x)l < c we can keep n fixed and let m tend to
ao. It follows that lf(x) - fn(x) I ~ c for n ~ no and all x in E. Hence the convergence is uniform. For practical use the following test is the most applicable: If a sequence of functions lfn(x)} is a contraction of a convergent sequence of constants (an}, then the sequence lfn(x)} is uniformly convergent. The hypothesis means that lfm(x) - fn(x)! ~ lam - ani on E, and the con


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 37
elusion follows immediately by Cauchy's condition. In the case of series this criterion, in a somewhat weaker form, becomes particularly simple. We say that a series with variable terms
f1(x) + fz(x) + Â· Â· Â· + fn(x) + Â· Â· Â·
has the series with positive terms
a1 + az + Â· Â· Â· + an + Â· Â· Â·
for a majorant if it is true that \fn(x) \ ~ Man for some constant M and for all sufficiently large n; conversely, the first series is a minorant of the second. In these circumstances we have
Therefore, if the majorant converges, the minorant converges uniformly. This condition is frequently referred to as the Weierstrass M test. It has the slight weakness that it applies only to series which are also absolutely convergent. The general principle of contraction is more complicated, but has a wider range of applicability.

2.4. Power Series. A power series is of the form
(17)
where the coefficients an and the variable z are complex. A little more generally we may consider series
"L' an(Z - zo)n
n=O
which are power series with respect to the center 7o, but the difference is so slight that we need not do so in a formal manllf~r. As an almost trivial example we consider the geometric series
1 + z + z2+ Â· Â· Â· + zn +
whose partial sums can be written in the form
1- z"
1 + z + Â· Â· . + zn-1 = _ _,
1- z
Since zn ----7 0 for !z! < 1 and !zn! ~ 1 for !z! ~ 1 we conclude that the
geometric series converges to 1/(1 - z) for !z! < 1, diverges for !z! ~ l.
It turns out that the behavior of the geometric series is typical. Indeed, we shall find that every power series converges inside a circle and diverges outside the same circle, except that it may happen that the series converges only for z = 0, or that it converges for all values of z. More precisely, we shall prove the following theorem due to Abel:
Theorem 2. For every power series (17) there exists a number R, 0 ~ R ~ ao, called the radius of convergence, with the following properties:
(i) The series converges absolutely for every z with !z! < R. If 0 ~
p < R the convergence is un~form for !z! ~ p.
(ii) If !z! > R the terms of the series are unbounded, and the series is consequently divergent.
(iii) In !z! < R the sum of the series is an analytic function. The derivative can be obtained by termwise differentiation, and the derived series has the same radius of convergence.
The circle !zl = R is called the circle of convergence; nothing is claimed about the convergence on the circle. We shall show that the assertions in the theorem are true if R is chosen according to the formula

This is known as Hadamard's formula for the radius of convergence.
If \z\ < R we can find p so that \z\ < p < R. Then 1/p > 1/R, and
by the definition of limes superior there exists an no such that \an\ 11n < 1/p,
\an\ < 1/p" for n ~ n 0â¢ It follows that \anzn\ < (\z\/ p)n for large n, so that the power series (17) has a convergent geometric series as a majorant, and is consequently convergent. To prove the uniform convergence for
\z\ ~ p < R we choose a p1 with p < p1 < R and find /anz"/ ~ (pj p1)n for n ~ n 0â¢ Since the majorant is convergent and has constant terms we
conclude by Weierstrass's M test that the power series is uniformly convergent.
If \z\ > R we choose p so that R < p < \z\. Since 1/p < 1/R there
are arbitrarily large n such that \an\ 1fn > 1/p, /an\ > 1/pn. Thus
\anzn\ > (lz\/p)" for infinitely many n, and the terms are unbounded.

f(z) = ao + a1z + a2z2 + Â· Â· Â·
f'(z) = a1 + Za2z + 3aaz2 + Â· Â· Â·
f"(z) = Za2 + 6a 3z + 12a4z2 + Â·

f<kl(z) = k!ak + 11 Â· ak+tZ + 21 Â· ak+2Z2 +
In particular, if we look at the last line we see that a,, = j<kl(O)/k!, and the power series becomes
f" (0) J<n) (0)
f(z) = f(O) + f'(O)z + 2T Z2 + Â· Â· Â· + -----n! zn + Â· Â· Â·
This is the familiar Taylor-Maclaurin development, but we have proved it only under the assumption thatf(z) has a power series development. We do know that the development is uniquely determined, if it exists, but the main part is still missing, namely that every analytic function has a Taylor development.

3. THE EXPONENTIAL AND TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
The person who approaches calculus exclusively from the point of view of real numbers will not expect any relationship between the exponential function e"' and the trigonometric functions cos x and sin x. Indeed, these functions seem to be derived from completely different sources and with different purposes in mind. He will notice, no doubt, a similarity between the Taylor developments of these functions, and if willing to use imaginary
arguments he will be able to derive Euler's formula eix = cos x + i sin x as a formal identity. But it took the genius of a Gauss to analyze its full depth. With the preparation given in the preceding section it will be easy to define ez, cos z and sin z for complex z, and to derive the relations between these functions. At the same time we can define the logarithm as the inverse function of the exponential, and the logarithm leads in turn to the correct definition of the argument of a complex number, and hence to the nongeometric definition of angle.
3.1. The Exponential. We may begin by defining the exponential
function as the solution of the differential equation

f(z) = ao + a1z + Â· Â· Â· + anz" + Â· Â· Â·
.f'(z) = a1 + 2a2z + Â· Â· Â· + nanz"- 1 + Â·
If (20) is to be satisfied, we must have an-1 = nan, and the initial condition gives ao = 1. It follows by induction that a, = 1/n!. The solution is denoted by eâ¢ or exp z, depending on purely typographical considerations. We must show of course that the series

converges. It does so in the whole plane, for yn!---7 ao (proof by the reader). It is a consequence of the differential equation that eâ¢ satisfies the addition theorem
(22)
Indeed, we find that D(eâ¢ Â· ec-â¢) = eâ¢ Â· ec-z + eâ¢ Â· ( -ec-z) = 0. Hence
eâ¢ Â· ec-z is a constant. The value of the constant is found by setting z = 0. We conclude that eâ¢ Â· ec-z = ec, and (22) follows for z = a, c = a+ b.
Remark. We have used the fact thatf(z) is constant ifj'(z) is identically
zero. This is certainly so iff is defined in the whole plane. For iff = u + iv
. au au av av
we obtam- = - = - = - = 0 and the real version of the theorem
ax ay ax ay '
shows that f is constant on every horizontal and every vertical line. As a particular case of the addition theorem eâ¢ Â· e-â¢ = 1. This shows that e' is never zero. For real x the series development (21) shows that
e"' > 1 for x > 0, and since e"' and e-"' are reciprocals, 0 < e"' < 1 for x < 0.
The fact that the series has real coefficients shows that exp zis the complex
conjugate of exp z. Hence Jei11\2 = ei11 â¢ e-iy = 1, and Jez+iy\ = e"'.

For real z they reduce to the familiar Taylor developments of cos x and sin x, with the significant difference that we have now redefined these functions without use of geometry. From (23) we obtain further Euler's formula
eiâ¢ = cos z + i sin z
as well as the identity
cos2 z + sin2 z = 1.
It follows likewise that
D cos z = - sin z,
The addition formulas
D sin z = cos z.
cos (a +b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b
sin (a + b) = cos a sin b + sin a cos b
are direct consequences of (23) and the addition theorem for the exponential function. The other trigonometric functions tan z, cot z, sec z, cosec z are of secondary importance. They are defined in terms of cos z and sin z in the customary manner. We find for instance
. eiz - e-â¢z

3.3. The Periodicity. We say that f(z) has the period c if f(z + c) = f(z)


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 45
for all z. Thus a period of eâ¢ satisfies eâ¢+c = eâ¢, ore< = 1. It follows that c = iw with real w; we prefer to say that w is a period of eiâ¢. We shall show that there are periods, and that they are all integral multiples of a positive period wo. Of the many ways to prove the existence of a period we choose the following: From D sin y = cosy ~ 1 and sin 0 = 0 we obtain sin y < y
for y > 0, either by integration or by use of the mean-value theorem. In
the same way D cosy = - sin y > -y and cos 0 = 1 gives cosy > 1 
y2/2, which in turn leads to sin y > y - y3/6 and finally to cosy < 1 
y2/2 + y4/24. This inequality shows that cos v3 < 0, and therefore
there is a Yo between 0 and v3 with cos Yo = 0. Because
cos2 yo + sin2 Yo = 1
we have sin Yo = Â± 1, that is, eivo = Â± i, and hence e4iYo = 1. We have shown that 4y 0 is a period. Actually, it is the smallest positive period. To see this, take 0 < y
<YoÂ· Then sin y > y(1 - y2/6) > y/2 > 0, which shows that cosy is
strictly decreasing. Because sin y is positive and cos2 y + sin2 y = 1 it
follows that sin y is strictly increasing, and hence sin y < sin y 0 = 1.
The double inequality 0 < sin y < 1 guarantees that eiY is neither Â± 1 nor
Â±i. Therefore e4iY ~ 1, and 4y 0 is indeed the smallest positive period. We denote it by w0â¢ Consider now an arbitrary period w. Th6lre exists an integer n such
that nwo ~ w < (n + 1)wo. If w were not equal to nwo, then w - nwo
would be a positive period < w0â¢ Since this is not possible, every period must be an integral multiple of wo.
The smallest positive period of e;z is denoted by 21r. In the course of the proof we have shown that
e"i/2 = i,
These equations demonstrate the intimate relationship between the numbers e and 1r. When yincreases from 0 to 21r, the point w = eiY describes the unit cirrle [w[ = 1 in the positive sense, namely from 1 over i to -1 and back over
-ito 1. For every w with [w[ = 1 there is one and only one y from the
half-open interval 0 ~ y < 21r such that w = eiY. All this follows readily from the established fact that cos y is strictly decreasing in the "first quadrant," that is, between 0 and 1rj2. From an algebraic point of view the mapping w = eiY establishes a homomorphism between the additive group of real numbers and the multiplicative group of complex numbers with absolute value 1. The kernel of the homomorphism is the subgroup formed by all integral multiples 21fn.


46 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
3.4. The Logarithm. Together with the exponential function we must also study its inverse function, the logarithm. By definition, z = log w is a root of the equation eâ¢ = w. First of all, since ez is always ~0, the number 0 has no logarithm. For w ~ 0 the equation ex+iv = w is equivalent to
(24) eill = wflwl.
The first equation has a unique solution x = log [w[, the real logarithm of
the positive number lw[. The right-hand member of the second equation (24) is a complex number of absolute value 1. Therefore, as we have just seen, it has one and only one solution in the interval 0 ~ y < 2'lr. In addition, it is also satisfied by ally that differ from this solution by an integral multiple of 2'lr. We see that every complex number other than 0 has infinitely many logarithms which differ from each other by multiples of 21Ti.
The imaginary part of log w is also called the argument of w, arg w, and it is interpreted geometrically as the angle, measured in radians, between the positive real axis and the half line from 0 through the point w. According to this definition the argument has infinitely many values which differ by multiples of 271", and
log w = log [w[ + i arg w.
With a change of notation, if lzl = r and arg z = e, then z = rei8â¢ This notation is so convenient that it is used constantly, even when the exponential function is not otherwise involved. By convention the logarithm of a positive number shall always mean the real logarithm, unless the contrary is stated. The symbol ab, where a and b are arbitrary complex numbers except for the condition a ~ 0, is always interpreted as an equivalent of exp (b log a). If a is restricted to positive numbers, log a shall be real, and ab has a single value. Otherwise log a is the complex logarithm, and ab has in general infinitely many values which differ by factors e2"inb. There will be a single value if and only if b is an integer n, and then ab can be interpreted as a power of a or a-1. If b is a rational number with the reduced form pjq, then ab has exactly q values and can be represented as {/CiP. The addition theorem of the exponential function clearly implies
log (z1z2) = log z1 + log Z2
arg (z1z2) = arg Z1 + arg z2,
but only in the sense that both sides represent the same infinite set of complex numbers. If we want to compare a value on the left with a value on the right, then we can merely assert that they differ by a multiple of 2ri (or 2'JT). (Compare with the remarks in Chap. 1, Sec. 2.1.)


COMPLEX FUNCTIONS 47
Finally we discuss the inverse cosine which is obtained by solving the equation
cos z = ~ (eiz + e-iz) = w.
This is a quadratic equation in eiz with the roots
eiz = w + - I wz - 1
-V '
and consequently
z =arc cos w = - i log (w Â± yw2 - 1).
We can also write these values in the form
arc cos w = Â± i log (w + v w2 - 1),
for w + V w2 - 1 and w - \/w2 - 1 are reciprocal numbers. The infinitely many values of arc cos w reflect the evenness and periodicity of cos z. The inverse sine is most easily defined by
â¢ 'lT
arc sm w = 2 - arc cos w.
It is worth emphasizing that in the theory of complex analytic functions all elementary transcendental functions can thus be expressed through eâ¢ and its inverse log z. In other words, there is essentially only one elementary transcendental function.

A function w = f(z) may be viewed as a mapping which represents a point z by its image w. The purpose of this chapter is to study, in a preliminary way, the special properties of mappings defined by analytic functions. In order to carry out this program it is desirable to develop the underlying concepts with sufficient generality, for otherwise we would soon be forced to introduce a great number of ad hoc definitions whose mutual rela!ionship would be far from clear. Since present-day students are exposed to abstraction and generality at quite an early stage, no apologies are needed. It is perhaps more appropriate to sound a warning that greatest possible generality should not become a purpose. In the first section we develop the fundamentals of point set topology and metric spaees. There is no need to go very far, for our main concern is with the properties that are essential for the study of analytic functions. If the student feels that he is already thoroughly familiar with this material, he should read it only for terminology. The author believes that proficiency in the study of analytic functions requires a mixture of geometric feeling and computational skill. The second and third sections, only loosely connected with the first, are expressly designed to develop geome!ric feeling by way of detailed study of elementary mappings. At the same time we try to stress rigor in geometric thinking, to the point where the geometric image becomes the guide but not the foundation of reasoning.

50 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
1. ELEMENTARY POINT SET TOPOLOGY
The branch of mathematics which goes under the name of topology is concerned with all questions directly or indirectly related to continuity. The term is traditionally used in a very wide sense and without strict limits. Topological considerations are extremely important for the foundation of the study of analytic functions, and the first systematic study of topology was motivated by this need. The logical foundations of set theory belong to another discipline. Our approach will be quite naive, in keeping with the fact that all our applications will be to very familiar objects. In this limited framework no logical paradoxes can occur.
1.1. Sets and Elements. In our language a set will be a collection of identifiable objects, its elements. The reader is familiar with the notation x EX which expresses that x is an element of X (as a rule we denote sets by capital letters and elements by small letters). Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. X is a subset of Y if every element of X is also an element of Y, and this relationship is indicated by X C Y or Y::) X (we do not exclude the possibility that X = Y). The
empty set is denoted by 0. A set can also be referred to as a space, and an element as a point. Subsets of a given space are usually called point sets. This lends a geometric flavor to the language, but should not be taken too literally. For instance, we shall have occasion to consider spaces whose elements an~ functions; in that case a "paint" is a function. The intersection of two sets X and Y, denoted by X (\ Y, is formed by all points which are elements of both X and Y. The union XU Y consists of all points which are elements of either X or Y, including those which are elements of both. One can of course form the intersection and union of arbitrary collections of sets, whether finite or infinite in number. The complement of a set X consists of all points which are not in X; it will be denoted by "'X. We note that the complement depends on the totality of points under consideration. For instance, a set of real numbers has one complement with respect to the real line and another with respect to the complex plane. More generally, if X C Y we can consider the relative complement Y ""'X which consists of all points that are in Y but not in X (we find it clearer to use this notation only when X C Y).
It is helpful to keep in mind the distributive laws
XU (Y fl Z) (XU Y) n (XU Z)
X fl (Y U Z) = (X fl Y) U (X n Z)


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 51
and the De Morgan laws
"-'(X IJ Y) = "'X 1\ ""'Y "'(X 1\ Y) = "'X IJ ""'Y.
These are purely logical identities, and they have obvious generalizations to arbitrary collections of sets.
1.2. Metric Spaces. For all considerations of limits and continuity it is essential to give a precise meaning to the terms "sufficiently near" and "arbitrarily near." In the spaces Rand C of real and complex numbers, respectively, such nearness can be expressed by a quantitative condition \x - y\ < e. For instance, to say that a set X contains all x sufficiently
near to y means that there exists an e > 0 such that x eX whenever
\x - y\ < e. Similarly, X contains points arbitrarily near to y if to every
e > 0 there exists an x eX such that \x - y\ < e. What we need to describe nearness in quantitative terms is obviously a distance d(x,y) between any two points. We say that a set Sis a metric space if there is defined, for every pair xeS, yeS, a nonnegative real number d(x,y) in such a way that the following conditions are fulfilled: 1. d(x,y) = 0 if and only if x = y.
2. d(y,x) = d(x,y).
3. d(x,z) ~ d(x,y) + d(y,z).
The last condition is the triangle inequality. For instance, R and C are metric spaces with d(x,y) = \x - y\. The n-dimensional euclidean space Rn is the set of real n-tuples
X = (x 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , Xn)
n
with a distance defined by d(x,y) 2 = 2: (x; - y.)2. We recall that we
1
have defined a distance in the extended complex plane by
d(z z') - 2\z - z'\
' - v-----r,:(1:;=+~\z:::;:;:2\~)(~1'=;=+=;::\z::;::;2'\)~
(see Chap. 1, Sec. 2.4); since this represents the euclidean distance between the stereographic images on the Riemann sphere, the triangle inequality is obviously fulfilled. An example of a function space is given by C[a,b],
the set of all continuous functions defined on the interval a ~ x ~ b. It becomes a metric space if we define distance by d(f,g) = max \f(x) - g(x) \. In terms of distance, we introduce the following terminology: For
any o > 0 and any y e S, the set B(y,o) of all x e S with d(x,y) < o is called


52 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
the ball with center y and radius o. It is also referred to as the a-neighborhood of y. The general definition of neighborhood is as follows:
Definition l. A set N C Sis called a neighborhood of y E S if it contains a ball B(y,o).
In other words, a neighborhood of y is a set which contains all points sufficiently near to y. We use the notion of neighborhood to define open set:
Definition 2. A set is open if it is a neighborhood of each of its elements.
The definition is interpreted to mean that the empty set is open (the condition is fulfilled because the set has no elements). The following is an immediate consequence of the triangle inequality:
Every ball is an open set.
Indeed, if z E B(y,o), then o' = 0 - d(y,z) > 0. The triangle in
equality shows that B(z,o') C B(y,o), for d(x,z) < o' gives d(x,y) < o' +
d(y,z) = o. Hence B(y,o) is a neighborhood of z, and since z was any point in B(y,o) we conclude that B(y,o) is an open set. For greater emphasis a ball is sometimes referred to as an open ball, to distinguish it
from the closed ball formed by all x E S with d(x,y) ~ o. In the complex plane B(z 0,o) is an open disk with center z0 and radius o; it consists of all complex numbers z which satisfy the strict inequality
lz - zol < o. We have just proved that it is an open set, and the reader is urged to interpret the proof in geometric terms. The complement of an open set is said to be closed. In any metric space the empty set and the whole space are at the same time open and closed, and there may be other sets with the same property.
The following properties of open and closed sets are fundamental: The 1:ntersection of a finite number of open sets is open. The union of any collection of open sets is open. The union of a finite number of clo-sed sets is closed. The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed.
The proofs are so obvious that they can be left to the reader. It should be noted that the last two statements follow from the first two by use of the De Morgan laws. There are many terms in common usage which are directly related to the idea of open sets. A complete Jist would be more confusing than helpful, and we shall limit ourselves to the following: interior, closure,


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 53
boundary, exterior.
(i) The interior of a set X is the largest open set contained in X. It
exists, for it may be characterized as the union of all open sets ex. It can also be described as the set of all points of which X is a neighborhood. We denote it by Int X. (ii) The closure of X is the smallest closed set which contains X, or the intersection of all closed sets :JX. A point belongs to the closure of X if and only if all its neighborhoods intersect X. The closure is usually denoted by X-, infrequently by Cl X. (iii) The boundary of X is the closure minus the interior. A point belongs to the boundary if and only if all its neighborhoods intersect both X and "'X. Notation: Bd X or aX. (iv) The exterior of X is the interior of "'X. It is also the complement of the closure. As such it can be denoted by "'X-. Observe that Int X C X C X- and that X is open if Int X = X, closed if X- = X. Also, X C Y implies Int X C Int Y, x- C Y-. For added convenience we shall also introduce the notions of isolated point and accumulation point. We say that x EX is an isolated point of X if x has a neighborhood whose intersection with X reduces to the point x. An accumulation point is a point of X- which is not an isolated point. It is clear that x is an accumulation point of X if and only if every neighborhood of x contains infinitely many points from X.
EXERCISES

Suppose that there are given two distance functions d(x,y) and d1(x,y) on the same spaceS. They are said to be equivalent if they determine the same open sets. Show that d and d1 are equivalent if to every

54 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
1.3. Connectedness. If E is any nonempty subset of a metric spaceS we may consider E as a metric space in its own right with the same distance function d(x,y) as on all of S. Neighborhoods and open sets onE are defined as on any metric space, but an open set onE need not be open when regarded as a subset of S. To avoid confusion neighborhoods and open sets onE are often referred to as relative neighborhoods and relatively open sets. As an example, if we regard the closed interval 0 ~ x ~ 1 as a subspace of R, then the semiclosed interval 0 ~ x < 1 is relatively open, but not open in R. Henceforth, when we say that a subset E has some specific topological property, we shall always mean that it has this property as a subspace, and its subspace topology is called the relative topology. Intuitively speaking, a space is connected if it consists of a single piece. This is meaningness unless we define the statement in terms of nearness. The easiest way is to give a negative characterization: Sis not connected if there exists a partition S = A U B into open subsets A and B. It is understood that A and Bare disjoint and nonempty. The connectedness of a space is often used in the following manner: Suppose that we are able to construct two complementary open subsets A and B of S; if S is connected, we may conclude that either A or B is empty. A subset E C S is said to be connected if it is connected in the relative topology. At the risk of being pedantic we repeat:
Definition 3. A subset of a metric space is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint relatively open sets none of which is empty.
If E is open, a subset of E is relatively open if and only if it is open. Similarly, if E is closed, relatively closed means the same as closed. We can therefore state: An open set is connected if it cannot be decomposed into two open sets, and a closed set is connected if it cannot be decomposed into two closed sets. Again, none of the sets is allowed to be empty. Trivial examples of connected sets are the empty set and any set that consists of a single point. In the case of the real line it is possible to name all connected sets. The most important result is that the whole line is connected, and this is indeed one of the fundamental properties of the real-number system. An interval is defined by an inequality of one of the four types:
a < x < b, a ~ x < b, a < x ~ b, a ~ x ~ b. t For a = - oo or
b = + oo this includes the semi-infinite intervals and the whole line.
t We denote open intervals by (a,b) and closed intervals by [a,b]. Another eommon practice is to denote open intervals by ]a,b[ and semiclosed intervals by ]a,b] or [a,b[.
It is always understood that a < b.

Theorem I. The nonempty connected subsets of the real line are the intervals.
We reproduce one of the classical proofs, based on the fact that any monotone sequence has a finite or infinite limit. Suppose that the real lineR is represented as the union R = AU B of two disjoint closed sets. If neither is empty we can find a 1 E A and
b1 E B; we may assume that a1 < b1. We bisect the interval (a1,b1) and
note that one of the two halves has its left end point in A and its right end point in B. We denote this interval by (a2,b2) and continue the process indefinitely. In this way we obtain a sequence of nested intervals (an,bn) with an E A, bn E B. The sequences {an} and {bn} have a common limit c. Since A and B are closed c would have to be a common point of A and B. This contradiction shows that either A or B is empty, and hence R is connected. With minor modifications the same proof applies to any interval. Before proving the converse we make an important remark. Let E be an arbitrary subset of R and call a a lower bound of E if a ~ x for all x E E. Consider the set A of all lower bounds. It is evident that the complement of A is open. As to A itself it is easily seen that A is open whenever it does not contain any largest number. Because the line is connected, A and its complement cannot both be open unless one of them is empty. There are thus three possibilities: either A is empty, A contains a largest number, or A is the whole line. The largest number a of A, if it exists, is called the greatest lower bound of E; it is commonly denoted as g.l.b. x or inf x for x E E. If A is empty, we agree to set
a = - oo, and if A is the whole line we set a = + oo. With this convention every set of real numbers has a uniquely determined greatest
lower bound; it is clear that a = + oo if and only if the set E is empty. The least upper bound, denoted as I. u. b. x or sup x for x E E, is defined in a
corresponding manner.t Returning to the proof, we assume that E is a connected set with the greatest lower bound a and the least upper bound b. All points of E lie between a and b, limits included. Suppose that a point ~ from the open
interval (a,b) did not belong to E. Then the open sets defined by x < ~
and x > ~cover E, and because E is connected, one of them must fail to meet E. Suppose, for instance, that no point of E lies to the left of ~ Then ~ would be a lower bound, in contradiction with the fact that a is the greatest lower bound. The opposite assumption would lead to a similar contradiction, and we conclude that ~ must belong to E. It follows that E is an open, closed, or semiclosed interval with the end points a and b; the
cases a = - oo and b = + oo are to be included. t The HUpremum of a Hequence waH introduced alren,dy in Chap. 2, Sec. 2.1.

In the course of the proof we have introduced the notions of greatest lower bound and least upper bound. If the set is closed and if the bounds are finite, they must belong to the set, in which case they are called the minimum and the maximum. In order to be sure that the bounds are finite we must know that the set is not empty and that there is some finite lower bound and some finite upper bound. In other words, the E>et must lie in a finite interval; such a set is said to be bounded. We have proved:
Theorem 2. Any closed and bounded nonempty set of real numbers has a minimum and a maximum.
The structure of connected sets in the plane is not nearly so simple as in the case of the line, but the following characterization of open connected sets contains essentially all the information we shall need.
Theorem 3. A nonempty open set in the plane is connected if and only if any two of its points can be joined by a polygon which lies in the set.
The notion of a joining polygon is so simple that we need not give a formal definition. We prove first that the condition is necessary. Let A be an open connected set, and choose a point a E A. We denote by A 1 the subset of A whose points can be joined to a by polygons in A, and by A2 the subset whose points cannot be so joined. Let us prove that At and A2 are both
open. First, if at EAt there exists a neighborhood lz - a1l < E contained in A. All points in this neighborhood can be joined to a 1 by a line segment, and from there to a by a polygon. Hence the whole neighborhood
is contained in Ar, and At is open. Secondly, if a2 E A2, let iz - a 21 < 10
be a neighborhood contained in A. If a point in this neighborhood could be joined to a by a polygon, then a2 could be joined to this point by a line segment, and from there to a. This is contrary to the definition of A 2, and we conclude that A2 is open. Since A was connected either A 1 or A2 must be empty. But A1 contains the point a; hence A 2 is empty, and all points can be joined to a. Finally, any two points in A can be joined by way of a, and we have proved that the condition is necessary. For future use we remark that it is even possible to join any two points by a polygon whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The proof is the same. In order to prove the sufficiency we assume that A has a representation A = A1 U A2 as the union of two disjoint open sets. Choose a 1 E A 1,
a2 E A2 and suppose that these points can be joined by a polygon in A.


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 57
One of the sides of the polygon must then join a point in At to a point in A2, and for this reason it is sufficient to consider the case where at and a2 are joined by a line segment. This segment has a parametric representa
tion z = at + t(a2 - at) where t runs through the interval 0 ~ t ~ 1.
The subsets of the interval 0 < t < 1 which correspond to points in At and A 2, respectively, are evidently open, disjoint, and nonvoid. This contradicts the connectedness of the interval, and we have proved that the condition of the theorem is sufficient. The theorem generalizes easily to Rn and Cn.
Definition 4. A nonempty connected open set is called a region.
By Theorem 3 the whole plane, an open disk lz - ai < p, and a half
plane are regions. The same is true of any /l-neighborhood in Rn. A region is the more-dimensional analogue of an open interval. The closure of a region is called a closed region. It should be observed that different regions may have the same closure. It happens frequently that we have to analyze the structure of sets which are defined very implicitly, for instance in the course of a proof. In such cases the first step is to decompose the set into its maximal connected components. As the name indicates, a component of a set is a connected subset which is not contained in any larger connected subset.
Theorem 4. Every set has a unique decomposition into components.
If E is the given set, consider a point a E E and let C(a) denote the union of all connected subsets of E that contain a. Then C(a) is sure to contain a, for the set consisting of the single point a is connected. If we can show that C(a) is connected, then it is a maximal connected set, in other words a component. It would follow, moreover, that any two components are either disjoint or identical, which is precisely what we want to prove. Indeed, if c E C(a) (\ C(b), then C(a) C C(c) by the definition of C(c) and the connectedness of C(a). Hence a E C(c), and by the same reasoning C(c) C C(a), so that in fact C(a) = C(c). Similarly C(b) = C(c), and consequently C(a) = C(b). We call C(a) the component of a. Suppose that C(a) were not connected. Then we could find relatively
open sets A, B ~ J1 such that C(a) = AU B, A(\ B =fl. We may assume that a E A while B contains a point b. Since bE C(a) there is a connected set Eo C E which contains a and b. The representation Eo = (Eo(\ A) U (Eo(\ B) would be a decomposition into relatively open subsets, and since a E Eo(\ A, bE Eo(\ B neither part would be empty. This is a contradiction, and we conclude that C(a) is connected.


58 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
Theorem 5. In R n the components of any open set are open.
This is a consequence of the fact that the /l-neighborhoods in Rn are connected. Consider a E C(a) C E. If E is open it contains B(a,il) and because B(a,il) is connected B(a,il) C C(a). Hence C(a) is open. A little more generally the assertion is true for any space S which is locally connected. By this we mean that any neighborhood of a point a contains a connected neighborhood of a. The proof is left to the reader. In the case of Rn we can conclude, furthermore, that the number of components is countable. To see this we observe that every open set must contain a point with rational coordinates. The set of points with rational coordinates is countable, and may thus be expressed as a sequence {pklÂ· For each component C(a), determine the smallest k such that Pk E C(a). To different components correspond different k. We conclude that the components are in one-to-one correspondence with a subset of the natural numbers, and consequently the set of components is countable.
For instance, every open subset of R is a countable union of disjoint open intervals.
Again, it is possible to analyze the proof and thereby arrive at a more general result. We shall say that a set E is dense in S if E- = S, and we shall say that a metric space is sep:trable if there exists a countable subset which is dense inS. We are led to the following result:
In a locally connected separable space every open set is a countable union of disjoint regions.

1.4. Compactness. The notions of convergent sequences and Cauchy sequences are obviously meaningful in any metric space. Indeed, we would say that Xn ----7 x if d(xn,x) ----7 0, and we would say that {xn} is a Cauchy sequence if d(xn,Xm) ----7 0 as n and m tend to oo. It is clear that every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. For R and C we have proved the converse, namely that every Cauchy sequence is convergent (Chap. 2, Sec. 2.1), and it is not hard to see that this property carries over to any Rn. In view of its importance the property deserves a special name.
Definition 5. A metric space is said to be complete if every Cauchy sequence is convergent.
A subset is complete if it is complete when regarded as a subspace. The reader will find no difficulty in proving that a complete subset of a metric space is closed, and that a closed subset of a complete space is complete. We shall now introduce the stronger concept of compactness. It is stronger than completeness in the sense that every compact space or set is complete, but not conversely. As a matter of fact it will turn out that the compact subsets of R and C are the closed bounded sets. In view of this result it would be possible to dispense with the notion of compactness, at least for the purposes of this book, but this would be unwise, for it would mean shutting our eyes to the most striking property of bounded and closed sets of real or complex numbers. The outcome would be that we would have to repeat essentially the same proof in many different connections. There are several equivalent characterizations of compactness, and it is a matter of taste which one to choose as definition. Whatever we do the uninitiated reader will feel somewhat bewildered, for he will not be able to discern the purpose of the definition. This is not surprising, for it took a whole generation of mathematicians to agree on the best approach. The consensus of present opinion is that it is best to focus the attention on the different ways in which a given set can be covered by open sets. Let us say that a collection of open sets is an open covering of a set X if X is contained in the union of the open sets. A subcovering is a subcollection with the same property, and a finite covering is one that consists of a finite number of sets. The definition of compactness reads:
Definition 6. A set X is compact if and only if every open covering of X contains a finite subcovering.
In this context we are thinking of X as a subset of a metric space S,


60 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
and the covering is by open sets of S. But if U is an open set in S, then U (\ X is an open subset of X (a relatively open set), and conversely every open subset of X can be expressed in this form (Sec. 1.3, Ex. 1). For this reason it makes no difference whether we formulate the definition for a full space or for a subset. The property in the definition is frequently referred to as the HeineBorel property. Its importance lies in the fact that many proofs become particularly simple when formulated in terms of open coverings. We prove first that every compact space is complete. Suppose that X is compact, and let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence in X. If y is not the limit of {xn} there exists an e > 0 such that d(xn,Y) > 2a for infinitely many n. Determine no such that d(xm,Xn) < aform, n ;:;; no. We choose a fixed n ;:;; no for which d(xn,Y) > 2a. Then d(xm,Y) ;:;; d(xn,Y) - d(xm,Xn)
> E for all m ;:;; n 0â¢ It follows that the a-neighborhood B(y, 11:) contains only finitely many Xn (better: contains Xn only for finitely many n). Consider now the collection of all open sets U which contain only finitely many Xn. If {xn) is not convergent, it follows by the preceding reasoning that this collection is an open covering of X. Therefore it must contain a finite subcovering, formed by U 1, â¢â¢â¢ , UN. But that is clearly impossible, for since each U; contains only finitely many Xn it would follow that the given sequence is finite. Secondly, a compact set is necessarily bounded (a metric space is hounded if all distances lie under a finite bound). To see this, choose a point x0 and consider all balls B(xo,r). They form an open covering of X, and if X is compact, it contains a finite subcovering; in other words, X C B(xo,r1) U Â· Â· Â· U B(xo,rm), which means the same as X C B(xo,r)
with r = max (rb . .. , rm). For any x,y E X it follows that d(x,y) ~
d(x,x 0) + d(y,x 0) < 2r, and we have proved that X is bounded. But boundedness is not all we can prove. It is convenient to define a stronger property called total boundedness:
Definition 7. A set X is totally bounded if, for every 11: > 0, X can be covered by finitely many balls of radius 11:.
This is certainly true of any compact set. For the collection of all balls of radius 11: is an open covering, and the compactness implies that we can select finitely many that cover X. We observe that a totally bounded set is necessarily bounded, for if XC B(x1,11:) U Â· Â· Â· U B(xm,d,
then any two points of X have a distance <2E + max d(xi,x1). (The preceding proof that any compact set is bounded becomes redundant.) We have already proved one part of the following theorem:
Theorem 6. A set is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 61
To prove the other part, assume that the metric space S is complete and totally bounded. Suppose that there exists an open covering which does not contain any finite subcovering. Write e:n = 2-n. We know that S can be covered by finitely many B(x, e: t). If each had a finite subcovering, the same would be true of S; hence there exists a B(xt, e: t) which does not admit a finite subcovering. Because B(xt, e: 1) is itself totally bounded we can find an X2 E B(x 1, e: 1) such that B(x2, e: 2) has no
finite subcovering.t It is clear how to continue the construction: we obtain a sequence Xn with the property that B(xn, e:n) has no finite sub
covering and Xn+! E B(xn,â¢n). The second property implies d(xn,Xn+t) < e:n
and hence d(Xn,Xn+v) < E:n + E:n+l + Â· Â· Â· + E:n+v-1 < 2-n+l. Jt follows
that Xn is a Cauchy sequence. It converges to a limit y, and this y belongs to one of the open sets U in the given covering. Because U is open, it
contains a ball B(y,o). Choose n so large that d(xn,Y) < o/2 and e:n < o/2.
Then B(xn, e:n) C B(y,o), for d(X,Xn) < e:n implies d(x,y) ~ d(x,xn) +
d(xn,y) < o. Therefore B(xn, e:n) admits a finite subcovering, namely by the single set U. This is a contradiction, and we conclude that S has the Reine-Borel property.
Corollary. A subset of R or C is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
We have already mentioned this particular consequence. In one direction the conclusion is immediate: We know that a eompact set is bounded and complete; but Rand Care complete, and complete subsets of a complete space are closed. For the opposite conclusion we need to show that every bounded set in R or C is totally bounded. Let us take the case of C. If X is bounded it is contained in a disk, and hence in a square. The square can be subdivided into a finite number of squares with arbitrarily small side, and the squares can in turn be covered by disks with arbitrarily small radius. This proves that X is totally bounded, except for a small point that should not be glossed over. When Definition 7 is applied to a subset X C S it is slightly ambiguous, for it is not clear whether the E-neighborhoods should be with respect to X or with respect to S; that is, it is not clear whether we require their centers to lie on X. It happens that this is of no avail. In fact, suppose that we have covered X by E-neighborhoods whose centers do not necessarily lie on X. If such a neighborhood does not meet X it is superfluous, and can be dropped. If it does contain a point from X, then we can replace it by a 2E-neighborhood around that point, and we obtain a finite covering by 2E-neighborhoods with centers on X. For this reason the ambiguity is only apparent, and our proof that bounded subsets of C are totally bounded is valid.
t Here we are using the fact that any subset of a totally bounded set is totally
''-,l. The reader should prove this.


62 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
There is a third characterization of compact sets. It deals with the notion of limit point (sometimes called cluster value): We say that y is a limit point of the sequence {xn} if there exists a subsequence {Xn1 } that converges toy. A limit point is almost the same as an accumulation point
of the set formed by the points x,., except that a sequence permits repeti
tions of the same point. If y is a limit point, every neighborhood of y contains infinitely many x,.. The converse is also true. Indeed, suppose that <: k ~ 0. If every B(y, <: k) contains infinitely many Xn we can choose subscripts nk, by induction, in such a way that x,.k E B(y, Ek) and nk+r > nk. It is clear that {Xn1 } converges toy.
Theorem 7. A metric space is compact if and only if every infinite sequence has a limit point.
This theorem is usually referred to as the B olzano-Weierstrass theorem. The original formulation was that every bounded sequence of complex numbers has a convergent subsequence. It came to be recognized as an important theorem precisely because of the role it plays in the theory of analytic functions. The first part of the proof is a repetition of an earlier argument. If y is not a limit point of {x,.} it has a neighborhood which contains only finitely many Xn (abbreviated version of the correct phrase). If there were no limit points the open sets containing only finitely many Xn would form an open covering. In the compact case we could select a finite subcovering, and it would follow that the sequence is finite. The previous time we used this reasoning was to prove that a compact space is complete. We showed in essence that every sequence has a limit point, and then we observed that a Cauchy sequence with a limit point is necessarily convergent. For strict economy of thought it would thus have been better to prove Theorem 7 before Theorem 6, but we preferred to emphasize the importance of total boundedness as early as possible. It remains to prove the converse. In the first place it is clear that the Bolzano-Weierstrass property implies completeness. Indeed, we just pointed out that a Cauchy sequence with a limit point must be convergent. Suppose now that the space is not totally bounded. Then there exists an E > 0 such that the space cannot be covered by finitely many E-neighborhoods. We construct a sequence {Xn} as follows: x1 is arbitrary, and when xr, . . . , Xn have been selected we choose Xn+l so that it does not lie in B(xr, â¬) U Â· Â· Â· U B(xn, â¬). This is always possible because these neighborhoods do not cover the whole space. But it is clear that {x,.} has no convergent subsequence, for d(x,.,x,.) > Efor all m and n. We conclude that the Bolzano-Weierstrass property implies total boundedness. In view of Theorem 6 that is what we had to prove.

The reader should reflect on the fact that we have exhibited three characterizations of compactness whose logical equivalence is not at all trivial. It should be clear that results of this kind are particularly valuable for the purpose of presenting proofs as concisely as possible.

1.5. Continuous Functions. We shall consider functions f which are defined on a metric space S and have values in another metric space S'.
Functions are also referred to as mappings: we say that f maps S into S', and we write f: S ~ S'. Naturally, we shall be mainly concerned with real- or complex-valued functions; occasionally the latter are allowed to take values in the extended complex plane, ordinary distance being replaced by distance on the Riemann sphere. The space S is the domain of the function. We are of course free to
consider functions f whose domain is only a subset of S, in which rase the domain is regarded as a subspace. In most cases it is safe to slur over the distinction: a function on S and its restriction to a subset are usually denoted by the same symbol. If X C S the set of all values f(x) for x E S is called the image of X under j, and it is denoted by f(X). The inverse imagej-1(X') of X' C S' consists of all x t: S such thatf(x) EX'. Observe thatj(j--1(X')) C X', andj-1(f(X)) :J X. The definition of a continuous function needs practically no modifica
tion: f is continuous at a if to every E > 0 there exists b > 0 such that
d(x,a) < o implies d'(f(x),j(a)) < E. We are mainly concerned with functions that are continuous at all points in the domain of definition.


64 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
The following characterizations are immediate consequences of the definition:
A function is continuous if and only if the inverse image of every open set is open. A function is continuous if and only if the inverse image of every closed set is closed.
Iff is not defined on all of S, the words "open" and "closed," when referring to the inverse image, should of course be interpreted relatively
to the domain of f. It is very important to observe that these properties hold only for the inverse image, not for the direct image. For instance
the mapping f(x) = x2j(l + x2) of R into R has the image f(R) =
{y; 0 ~ y < 1} which is neither open nor closed. In this example f(R) fails to be closed because R is not compact. In fact, the following is true:
Theorem 8. Under a continuous mapping the image of every compact set is compact, and consequently closed.
Suppose that f is defined and continuous on the compact set X.
Consider a covering of f(X) by open sets U. The inverse images f-1(U) are open and form a covering of X. Because X is compact we can select a
finite subcovering: X C f- 1(U1) IJ Â· Â· Â· IJ f- 1(Um). It follows that f(X) C Ur IJ Â· Â· Â· IJ Um, and we have proved that f(X) is compact..
Corollary. A continuous real-valued function on a compact set has a maximum and a minimum.
The image is a closed bounded subset of R. The existence of a maximum and a minimum follows by Theorem 2.
Theorem 9. Under a continuous mapping the image of any connected set is connected.
We may assume that f is defined and continuous on the whole space S, and that f(S) is all of S'. Suppose that S' = A IJ B where A and B
are open and disjoint. Then S = f- 1(A) IJ f- 1(B) is a representation of
S as a union of disjoint open sets. If Sis connected either f- 1(A) = 0 or
f- 1(B) = 0, and hence A = 0 or B = 0. We conclude that S' is connected. A typical application is the assertion that a real-valued function which is continuous and never zero on a connected set is either always positive or always negative. In fact, the image is connected, and hence an interval. But an interval which contains positive and negative num


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 65
bers also contains zero. A mapping f :S ----7 S' is said to be one to one if f(x) = f(y) only for
x = y; it is said to be onto if f(S) = S'. t A mapping with both these
properties has an inverse f-\ defined on S'; it satisfiesf-1(f(x)) = x and f(f- 1(x')) = x'. In this situation, iff and f- 1 are both continuous we say that f is a topological mapping or a homeomorphism. A property of a set which is shared by all topological images is called a topological property. For instance, we have proved that compactness and connectedness are topological properties (Theorems 8 and 9). In this connection it is perhaps useful to point out that the property of being an open subset is not topological. If X C S and Y C S' and if X is homeomorphic to Y there is no reason why X and Y should be simultaneously open. It happens to be true if S = S' = Rn (invariance of the region), but this is a deep theorem that we shall not need. The notion of uniform continu~ty will be in constant use. Quite generally, a condition is said to hold uniformly with respect to a parameter if it can be expressed by inequalities which do not involve the parameter. Accordingly, a function f is said to be uniformly continuous on X if, to
every a > 0, there exists a o > 0 such that d'(f(xr),J(x2)) < E for all
pairs (x1,x2) with d(x 1,x2) < o. The emphasis is on the fact that ois not allowed to depend on x1.
Theorem 10. On a compact set every continuous function is uniformly continuous.
The proof is typical of the way the Reine-Borel property can be used.
Suppose that f is continuous on a compact set X. For every y 11: X there is a ball B(y,p) such that d'(f(x),j(y)) < E/2 for x 11: B(y,p); here p may depend on y. Consider the covering of X by the smaller balls B(y,p/2). There
exists a finite subcovering: X C B(y1,pr/2) U Â· Â· Â· U B(ym,Pm/2). Let o
be the smallest of the numbers pr/2, ... , Pm/2, and suppose that d(xr,x 2) <
o. There is a Yk with d(xr,Yk) < Pk/2, and we obtain d(x2,yk) < Pk/2 +
o ~ ok. Hence d'(f(x 1),j(yk)) < E/2 and d'(f(x 2),j(yk)) < E/2 so that
d' (f (x1) ,j(x 2)) < f as desired.
On sets which are not compact some continuous functions are uniformly continuous and others are not. For instance, the function z is uniformly continuous on the whole complex plane, but the function Z2 is not.
t These linguistically clumsy terms can be replaced by injective (for one to one) and surjective (for onto). A mapping with both properties is called bijective.

1.6. Topological Spaces. It is not necessary, and not always convenient, to express nearness in terms of distance. The observant reader will have noticed that most results in the preceding sections were formulated in terms of open sets. True enough, we used distances to define open sets, but there is really no strong reason to do this. If we decide to consider the open sets as the primary objects we must postulate axioms that they have to satisfy. The following axioms lead to the commonly accepted definition of a topological space:
Definition 8. A topological space is a set T together with a collection of its subsets, called open sets. The following conditions have to be fulfilled: (i) The empty set 0 and the whole space T are open sets. (ii) The intersection of any two open sets is an open set. (iii) The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is an open set.
We recognize at once that this terminology is consistent with our earlier definition of an open subset of a metric space. Indeed, properties (ii) and (iii) were strongly emphasized, and (i) is trivial. Closed sets are the complements of open sets, and it is immediately clear how to define interior, closure, boundary, and so on. Neighborhoods could be avoided, but they are rather convenient: N is a neighborhood of x if there exists an open set U such that x E U and U C N. Connectedness was defined purely by means of open sets. Hence the definition carries over to topological spaces, and the theorems remain true. The Reine-Borel property is also one that deals only with open sets. Therefore it makes perfect sense to speak of a compact topological space. However, Theorem 6 becomes meaningless, and Theorem 7 becomes false. As a matter of fact, the first serious difficulty we encounter is with


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 67
convergent sequences. The definition is clear: we say that Xn --t x if every neighborhood of x contains all but a finite number of the XnÂ· But if Xn --t x and Xn --t y we are not able to prove that x = y. This awkward situation is remedied by introducing a new axiom which characterizes the topological space as a Hausdorff space:
Definition 9. A topological space is called a Hausdorff space if any two distinct points are contained in disjoint open sets.
In other words, if x ~ y we require the existence of open sets U, V
such that x E U, y E V and U (\ V = 0. In the presence of this condition it is obvious that the limit of a convergent sequence is unique. We shall never in this book have occasion to consider a space that is not a Hausdorff space. This is not the place to give examples of topologies that cannot be derived from a distance function. Such examples would necessarily be very complicated and would not further the purposes of this book. The point is that it may be unnatural to introduce a distance in situations when one is not really needed. The reason for including this section has been to alert the reader that distances are dispensable.
2. CONFORMALITY
We now return to our original setting where all functions and variables are restricted to real or complex numbers. The role of metric spaces will seem disproportionately small: all we actually need are some simple applications of connectedness and compactness. The whole section is mainly descriptive. It centers on the geometric consequences of the existence of a derivative.
2.1. Arcs and Closed Curves. The equation of an arc 'Yin the plane is most conveniently given in parametric form x = x(t), y = y(t) where t runs through an interval a ~ t ~ {3 and x(t), y(t) are continuous func
tions. We can also use the complex notation z = z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)
which has several advantages. It is also customary to identify the arc 'Y with the continuous mapping of [a,{3]. When following this custom it is preferable to denote the mapping by z = 'Y(t). Considered as a point set an arc is the image of a closed finite interval under a continuous mapping. As such it is compact and connected. However, an arc is not merely a set of points, but very essentially also a succession of points, ordered by increasing values of the parameter. If a nondecreasing function t = <P(r) maps an interval a' ~ r ~ {3' onto a ~ t ~ {3, then z = z(<P(r)) defines the same succession of points as z = z(t).


68 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
We say that the first equation arises from the second by a change of parameter. The change is reversible if and only if <P(r) is strictly increasing. For
instance, the equation z = t2 + it\ 0 ~ t ~ 1 arises by a reversible change
of parameter from the equation z = t + it2, 0 ~ t ~ 1. A change of the parametric interval (a,{3) can always be brought about by a linear change
of parameter, which is one of the form t = ar + b, a > 0. Logically, the simplest course is to consider two arcs as different as soon as they are given by different equations, regardless of whether one equation may arise from the other by a change of parameter. In following this course, as we will, it is important to show that certain properties of arcs are invariant under a change of parameter. For instance, the initial and terminal point of an arc remain the same after a change of parameter.
If the derivative z'(t) = x'(t) + iy'(t) exists and is ~0, the arc 'Y has a tangent whose direction is determined by arg z'(t). We shall say that the arc is differentiable if z'(t) exists and is continuous (the term continuously differentiable is too unwieldy); if, in addition, z'(t) ~ 0 the arc iR said to be regular. An arc is piecewise differentiable or piecewise regular if the same conditions hold except for a finite number of values t; at these points z(t) shall still be continuous with left and right derivatives which are equal to the left and right limits of z'(t) and, in the case of a piecewise regular arc, ~0. The differentiable or regular character of an arc is invariant under the change of parameter t = <P(r) provided that <P'(r) is continuous and, for regularity, ~0. When this is the case, we speak of a differentiable or regular change of parameter.
An arc is simple, or a Jordan arc, if z(t1) = z(t2) only for t1 = t2. An arc is a closed curve if the end points coincide: z(a) = z({3). For closed curves a shift of the parameter is defined as follows: If the original equation is z = z(t), a ~ t ~ {3, we choose a point to from the interval (a,{3) and define a new closed curve whose equation is z = z(t) for to ~ t ~ {3 and
z = z(t - {3 + a) for {3 ~ t ~ to + {3 - a. The purpose of the shift is to get rid of the distinguished position of the initial point. The correct definitions of a differentiable or regular closed curve and of a simple closed curve (or Jordan curve) are obvious. The opposite arc of z = z(t), a ~ t ~ {3, is the arc z = z( -t), -{3 ~ t ~ -a. Opposite arcs are sometimes denoted by 'Y and -'Y, sometimes by 'Y and 'Y-\ depending on the connection. A constant function z(t) defines a point curve.
A circle C, originally defined as a locus \z - a\ = r, can be considered as a closed curve with the equation z = a+ reit, 0 ~ t ~ 21r. We will use this standard parametrization whenever a circle is introduced. This convention saves us from writing down the equation each time it is


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 69
needed; also, and this is its most important purpose, it serves as a definite rule to distinguish between C and -C.
2.2. Analytic Functions in Regions. When we consider the derivative
f'(z) = lim f(z +h) - f(z)
h->0 h
of a complex-valued function, defined on a set A in the complex plane, it is of course understood that z t: A and that the limit is with respect to values h such that z + h E: A. The existence of the derivative will therefore have a different meaning depending on whether z is an interior point or a boundary point of A. The way to avoid this is to insist that all analytic functions be defined on open sets. We give a formal statement of the definition:
Definition 10. A complex-valued function f(z), defined on an open set n,
is said to be analytic in n if it has a derivative at each point of n.
Sometimes one says more explicitly that f(z) is complex analytic. A commonly used synonym is holomorphic.
It is important to stress that the open set n is part of the definition. As a rule one should avoid speaking of an analytic function f(z) without
referring to a specific open set n on which it is defined, but the rule can
be broken if it is clear from the context what the set is. Observe that f
must first of all be a function, and hence single-valued. If n' is an open
subset of n, and if f(z) is analytic in n, then the restriction off to n' is
analytic in Q'; it is customary to denote the restriction by the same letter f. In particular, since the components of an open set are open, it is no loss
of generality to consider only the case where n is connected, that is to say a regt"on.
For greater flexibility of the language it is desirable to introduce the following complement to Definition 10:
Definition II. A function f(z) is analytic on an arbitrary point set A if it is the restriction to A of a function which is analytic in some open set containing A.
The last definition is merely an agreement to wse a convenient termi
nology. This is a case in which the set n need not be explicitly men
tioned, for the specific choice of n is usually immaterial as long as it contains
A. Another instance in which the mention of n can be suppressed is the phrase: "Let f(z) be analytic at zo." It means that a function f(z) is defined and has a derivative in some unspecified open neighborhood of z0â¢


70 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
Although our definition requires all analytic functions to be single
valued, it is possible to consider such multiple-valued functions as yz, log z, or arc cos z, provided that they are restricted to a definite region in which it is possible to select a single-valued and analytic branch of the function.
For instance, we may choose for n the complement of the negative
real axis z ~ 0; this set is indeed open and connected. In n one and
only one of the values of yz has a positive real part. With this choice
w = .Yz becomes a single-valued function in n; let us prove that it is
continuous. Choose two points ZI, z2 t: n and denote the corresponding
values of w by WI = UI + ivi, w2 = u2 + iv2 with ui, u2 > 0. Then
\zi -- z2J = Jwi - w~l = Jw1 - w2\ Â· Jw1 + w2J
and Jwi + w2J :;;; u1 + U2 > u1. Hence
I I < jz1 - z2l
WI- W2 UI
and it follows that w = yz is continuous at ZI. Once the continuity is established the analyticity follows by derivation of the inverse function z = w 2â¢ Indeed, with the notations used in calculus Ll.z -----t 0 implies Ll.w -----t 0. Therefore,
1. Ll.w 1. Ll.w
Im-= Im
az->O Ll.z aw->0 Ll.z
and we obtain
with the same branch of yz.
In the case of log z we can use the same region n, obtained by excluding the negative real axis, and define the principal branch of the logarithm
by the condition jim log z\ < 1r. Again, the continuity must be proved, but this time we have no algebraic identity at our disposal, and we are forced to use a more general reasoning. Denote the principal branch by
w = u + iv = log z. For a given point WI = U1 + ivi, \vi\ < 1r, and a
given E > 0, consider the set A in the w-plane which is defined by the inequalities \w - w1\ ~ a, JvJ ~ 1r, \u - ui\ ~ log 2. This set is closed and bounded, and for sufficiently small E it is not empty. The continuous function jew - ew1j has consequently a minimum p on A (Theorem 8, Corollary). This minimum is positive, for A does not contain any point
WI + n Â· 21ri. Choose o = min (p,-!eut), and assume that
Jz1 - z2J = jew, - ewâ¢\ < o.


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 71
Then w 2 cannot lie in A, for this would make \ew, - ewâ¢\ ~ p ~ fi.
Neither is it possible that u2 < U1- log 2 or u2 > u1 +log 2; in the
former case we would obtain \ew, - ewâ¢\ ~ e"' - e"' > -!e"' ~ fi, and in
the latter case lew, - ewâ¢\ ~ e"' - e"' > e"' > fi. Hence w2 must lie
in the disk lw - w1\ < E, and we have proved that w is a continuous function of z. From the continuity we conclude as above that the
derivative exists and equals 1/z.
The infinitely many values of arc cos z are the same as the values of
i log (z + yz 2 - 1). In this case we restrict z to the complement n' of
the half lines x ;;;:; -1, y = 0 and x ~ 1, y = 0. Since 1 - z2 is never
real and ;;;:; 0 inn', we can define y1 - z2 as in the first example and then
set yz2 - 1 = iy1 - z2â¢ Moreover, z + yz2 - 1 is never real inn',
for z + v z2 - 1 and z - v z2 - 1 are reciprocals and hence real only if z
and v z2 - 1 are both real; this happens only when z lies on the excluded parts of the real axis. Because n' is connected, it follows that all values
of- z + v z2 - 1 in n' are on the same side of the real axis, and since i is such a value they are all in the upper half plane. We can therefore define
an analytic branch of log (z + yz2 - 1) whose imaginary part lies between 0 and 7f. In this way we obtain a single-valued analytic function
arc cos z = i log (z + yz2 - 1)
in n' whose derivative is
arc cos z = ~ + = - - - 
D . 1 (1 z ) 1
z + v z2 - 1 v z2 - 1 y1 - z2
where y1 - z2 has a positive real part. There is nothing unique about the way in which the region and the single-valued branches have been chosen in these examples. Therefore, each time we consider a function such as log z the choice of the branch has to be specified. It is a fundamental fact that it is impossible to define a single-valued and analytic branch of log z in certain regions. This will be proved in the chapter on integration. All the results of Chap. II, Sec. 1.2 remain valid for functions which are analytic on an open set. In particular, the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function in n satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations
au av
-=-,
ax ay au av
ay = -axÂ·
Conversely, if u and v satisfy these equations in n, and if the partial derivatives are continuous, then u + iv is an analytic function in n. An analytic function in n degenerates if it reduces to a constant. In


72 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
the following theorem we shall list some simple conditions which have this consequence:
Theorem ll. An analytic function in a region n whose derivative vanishes identically must reduce to a constant. The same is true if either the real part, the imaginary part, the modulus, or the argument is constant.
The vanishing of the derivative implies that ilu/ilx, aujay, avjax, ilv/ily are all zero. It follows that u and v are constant on any line seg
ment in n which is parallel to one of the coordinate axes. In Sec. 1.3 we remarked, in connection with Theorem 3, that any two points in a region can be joined within the region by a polygon whose sides are parallel to
the axes. We conclude that u + iv is constant. If u or v is constant,
f'(z) = au _ i au = av + i av = 0
ax ily ay ax '
and hence f(z) must be constant. If u2 + v2 is constant, we obtain
uau+vav=O
ax ax and
au av av au
u- + v- = - u- + v- = 0.
ay ay ax ax
These equations permit the conclusion ilu/ilx = ilv/ilx = 0 unless the
determinant u2 + v2 vanishes. But if u2 + v2 = 0 at a single point it, is constantly zero and f(z) vanishes identically. Hence f(z) is in any case a constant. Finally, if arg f(z) is constant, we can set u = kv with constant k
(unless v is identically zero). But u - kv is the real part of (1 + ik)f,
and we conclude again that f must reduce to a constant.
Note that for this theorem it is essential that n is a region. If not,
we can only assert that f(z) is constant on each component of n.

2.3. Conformal Mapping. Suppose that an arc 'Y with the equation
z = z(t), a ~ t ~ {3, is contained in a region n, and let f(z) be defined
and continuous in n. Then the equation w = w(t) = f(z(t)) defines an arc 'Y' in the w-plane which may be called the image of 'YÂ·
Consider the case of an f(z) which is analytic in n. If z' (t) exists, we find that w'(t) also exists and is determined by
(1) w'(t) = f'(z(t))z'(t).
We will investigate the meaning of this equation at a point zo = z(to) with z'(to) rf 0 and f'(zo) rf 0.
The first conclusion is that w'(to) rf 0. Hence 'Y' has a tangent a~ Wo = f(zo), and its direction is determined by
(2) argw'(to) = argf'(zo) + argz'(to).
This relation asserts that the angle between the directed tangents to 'Y
at zo and to 'Y' at wo is equal to arg f' (z 0). It is hence independent of the curve 'YÂ· For this reason curves through zo which are tangent to each other are mapped onto curves with a common tangent at w0â¢ l\!foreover, two curves which form an angle at z0 are mapped upon curves forming the same angle, in sense as well as in size. In view of this property the mapping by w = f(z) is said to be conformal at all points withf'(z) rf 0. A related property of the mapping is derived by consideration of the modulus lf'(zo)l. We have
lim lf(z) - f(zo)l = lf'(zo)l,
z~zo lz - zo!
and this means that any small line segment with one end point at z0 is, in the limit, contracted or expanded in the ratio lf'(zo)l. In other words, the linear change of scale at zo, effected by the transformation w = f(z), is independent of the direction. In general this change of scale will vary from point to point. Conversely, it is clear that both kinds of conformality together imply
the existence off' (zo). It is less obvious that each kind will separately imply the same result, at least under additional regularity assumptions. To be more precise, Jet us assume that the partial derivatives afjax and afjay are continuous. Under this condition the derivative of w(t) = f(z(t)) can be expressed in the form
w' (to) = aj x' (to) + aj y' (to)
ax ay
where the partial derivatives are taken at z0â¢ In terms of z'(t0) this can

be rewritten as
'( ) 1 ( af . af) '( ) 1 ( af + . of)-,-----)(
W to = - - - ~ - z to + - - ~ - z to .
2 ax ay 2 ax ay
If angles are preserved, arg [w'(t 0)/z'(t0)] must be independent of arg z' (to). The expression
(3) ! (of_ i a.r) +! ( a.r + i of) z'(to)
2 ax ay 2 ax ay z'(to)
must therefore have a constant argument. As arg z'(to) is allowed to vary, the point represented by (3) describes a circle having the radius
~\(of/ox) + i(afjay)\. The argument cannot be constant on this circle unless its radius vanishes, and hence we must have
af . af
- = -2
ax ay
(4)
which is the complex form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Quite similarly, the condition that the change of scale shall be the same in all directions implies that the expression (3) has a constant modulus. On a circle the modulus is constant only if the radius vanishes or if the center lies at the origin. In the first case we obtain (4), and in the second case
af . af
- =2-Â·
ax ay
The last equation expresses the fact that f(z) is analytic. A mapping by the conjugate of an analytic function with a nonvanishing derivative is said to be indirectly conformal. It evidently preserves the size but reverses the sense of angles.
If the mapping of n by w = f(z) is topological, then the inverse function z = f- 1(w) is also analytic. This follows easily if f'(z) :;6 0, for then the derivative of the inverse function must be equal to 1/f'(z) at the point
z = .f-1(w). We shall prove later that f'(z) can never vanish in the case of a topological mapping by an analytic function.
The knowledge that f' (zo) :;6 0 is sufficient to conclude that the mapping is topological if it is restricted to a sufficiently small neighborhood of z0â¢ This follows by the theorem on implicit functions known from the cal
culus, for the Jacobian of the functions u = u(x,y), v = v(x,y) at the point
z0 is \.f' (z 0)\2 and hence :;6 0. Later we shall present a simpler proof of this important theorem.
But even if f'(z) :;6 0 throughout the region n, we cannot assert that the mapping of the whole region is necessarily topological. To illustrate


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 75
what may happen we refer to Fig. 3-1. Here the mappings of the sub
FIG. 3-1. Doubly covered region.
regions Q1 and Q2 are one to one, but the images overlap. It is helpful to think of the image of the whole region as a transparent film which partly covers itself. This is the simple and fruitful idea used by Riemann when he introduced the generalized regions now known as Riemann surfaces.
2.4. Length and Area. We have found that under a conformal mapping f(z) the length of an infinitesimal line segment at the point z is multiplied by the factor lf'(z) 1. Because the distortion is the same in all directions, infinitesimal areas will clearly be multiplied by lf'(z) 12â¢ Let us put this on a rigorous basis. We know from calculus that the
length of a differentiable arc 'Y with the equation z = z(t) = x(t) + iy(t),
a ~ t ~ b, is given by
L('Y) = fb vx'(t) 2+ y'(t) 2dt = fb lz'(t)l dt.
aa
The image curve 'Y' is determined by w = w(t) = f(z(t)) with the derivative w'(t) = f'(z(t))z'(t). Its length is thus
L('Y1) = j b If'(z( t)) liz'(t) I dt.
a
It is customary to use the shorter notations
(5) L('Y) = f ldzl,
1'
L('Y') = j lf'(z) lldzl.

Observe that in complex notation the calculus symbol ds for integration with respect to arc length is replaced by ldz 1. Now let E be a point set in the plane whose area

76 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
can be evaluated as a double Riemann integral. If f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) is a bijective differentiable mapping, then by the rule for changing integration variables the area of the image E' = f(E) is given by
A(E') = JJluxVy - UyVxl dx dy.
E
But if f(z) is a conformal mapping of an open set containing E, then UxVu - UyVx lf'(z) 12 by virtue of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and we obtain
(6) A(E') = JJ lf'(z) 12 dx dy.
E
The formulas (5) and (6) have important applications in the part of complex analysis that is frequently referred to as geometric function theory.
3. LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
Of all analytic functions the first-order rational functions have the simplest mapping properties, for they define mappings of the extended plane onto itself which are at the same time conformal and topological. The linear transformations have also very remarkable geometric properties, and for that reason their importance goes far beyond serving as simple examples of conformal mappings. The reader will do well to pay particular attention to this geometric aspect, for it will equip him with simple but very valuable techniques.
3.1. The Linear Group. We have already remarked in Chap. 2, Sec. 1.4 that a linear fractional transformation
(7) w = S(z)
with ad - be rf 0 has an inverse
z = S- 1(w)
az + b
cz + d
dw- b -cw +a
The special values S( oo) = ajc and S( -djc) = oo can be introduced
either by convention or as limits for z ____. oo and z ____. - d/c. With the latter interpretation it becomes obvious that Sis a topological mapping of the extended plane onto itself, the topology being defined by distances on the Riemann sphere. For linear transformations we shall usually replace the notation S(z)


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 77
by Sz. The representation (7) is said to be normalized if ad - be = 1. It is clear that every linear transformation has two normalized representations, obtained from each other by changing the signs of the coefficients. A convenient way to express a linear transformation is by use of homogeneous coordinates. If we write z = zt/z2, w = wtfwz we find that w = Sz if
(8)
or, in matrix notation,
W1 = az1 + bzz
Wz = ez1 + dzz
The main advantage of this notation is that it leads to a simple determination of a composite transformation w = S1Szz. If we use subscripts to distinguish between the matrices that correspond to 81, Sz it is immediate
that sls2 belongs to the matrix product
All linear transformations form a group. Indeed, the associative law (S1Sz)Sa = SI(SzSa) holds for arbitrary transformations, the identity w = z is a linear transformation, and the inverse of a linear transformation is linear. The ratios z1: z2 :;6 0:0 are the points of the complex projective line, and (8) identifies the group of linear transformations with the onedimensional projective group over the complex numbers, usually denoted by P(1,C). If we use only normalized representations, we can also identify it with the group of two-by-two matrices with determinant 1 (denoted SL(2,C)), except that there are two opposite matrices corresponding to the same linear transformation. We shall make no further use of the matrix notation, except for remarking that the simplest linear transformations belong to matrices of the form
The first of these, w = z + a, is called a parallel translation. The second,
w = kz, is a rotation if lkl = 1 and a homothetic transformation if k > 0.
For arbitrary complex k :;6 0 we can set k = lkl Â· k/lkl, and hence w = kz can be represented as the result of a homothetic transformation followed by a rotation. The third transformation, w = 1/z, is called an inversion. If c :;6 0 we can write
az + b be- ad a
---- +-Â·
ez + d - c2(z + dje) c


78 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
and this decomposition shows that the most general linear transformaion is composed by a translation, an inversion, a rotation, and a homothetic transformation followed by another translation. If c = 0, the inversion falls out and the last translation is not needed.

Z- Z4
If T were another linear transformation with the same property, then ST- 1 would leave 1, 0, oo invariant. Direct calculation shows that this is true only for the identity transformation, and we would have S = T. We conclude that S is uniquely determined.
Definition 12. The cross ratio (z1,z2,za,z4) is the image of z1 under the linear transformation which carries z2,z3,z4 into 1, 0, oo.
The definition is meaningful only if z2,z3,z4 are distinct. A conventional value can be introduced as soon as any three of the points are distinct, but this is unimportant.


ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS AS MAPPINGS 79
The cross ratio is invariant under linear transformations. In more precise formulation:
Theorem 12. If z1, z2, za, Z4 are distinct points in the extended plane and T
any linear transformation, then (Tzt,Tz2,Tz 3,Tz4) = (zt,Z2,za,z4).
The proof is immediate, for if Sz = (z,z 2,za,z4), then ST- 1 carries Tz2, Tza, Tz4 into 1, 0, oo. By definition we have hence
(Tzt,Tz 2,Tza,Tz4) = ST- 1(Tzt) = Szt = (zt,Z21Za,z4).
With the help of this property we can immediately write down the linear transformation which carries three given points z1, z2, za to prescribed positions w1, w2, wa. The correspondence must indeed be given by
In general it is of course necessary to solve this equation with respect tow.
Theorem 13. The cross ratio (zt,z2,za,z4) is real if and only 1j the four points lie on a circle or on a straight line.
This is evident by elementary geometry, for we obtain
and if the points lie on a circle this difference of angles is either 0 or Â±1r, depending on the relative location. For an analytic proof we need only show that the image of the real axis under any linear transformation is either a circle or a straight line. Indeed, Tz = (z,z 2,z3,z4) is real on the image of the real axis under the transformation T- 1 and nowhere else. The values of w = T- 1z for real z satisfy the equation Tw = Tw.

which is the equation of a circle. The last result makes it clear that we should not, in the theory of linear transformations, distinguish between circles and straight lines, A further justification was found in the fact that both correspond to circles on the Riemann sphere. Accordingly we shall agree to use the word
circle in this wider sense. t The following is an immediate corollary of Theorems 12 and 13:
Theorem 14. A linear transformation carries circles into circles.
EXERCISES
1. Find the linear transformation which carries 0, i, - i into 1, -1, 0. 2. Express the cross ratios corresponding to the 24 permutations of four points in terms of A. = (z1,zz,zs,z4). 3. If the consecutive vertices z1, z2, z3, z4 of a quadrilateral lie on a circle, prove that
and interpret the result geometrically. 4. Show that any four distinct points can be carried by a linear transformation to positions 1, -1, k, -k, where the value of k depends on the points. How many solutions are there, and how are they related?
3.3. Symmetry. The points z and z are symmetric with respect to the real axis. A linear transformation with real coefficients carries the real
axis into itself and z, z into points which are again symmetric. More generally, if a linear transformation T carries the real axis into a circle C, we shall say that the points w = Tz and w* = Tz are symmetric with respect to C. This is a relation between w, w* and C which does not depend on T. For if S is another transformation which carries the real
axis into c, then S-IT is a real transformation, and hence s-lw = S- 1Tz and S- 1w* = S- 1Tz are also conjugate. Symmetry can thus be defined in the following terms:
t This agreement will be in force only when dealing with linear transformations.

Definition 13. The points z and z* are said to be symmetric with respect to the circle C through z1, z2, z3 if and only if (z*,z1,z2,za) = (z,z1,z2,za).
The points on C, and only those, are symmetric to themselves. The mapping which carries z into z* is a one-to-one correspondence and is
called reflection with respect to C. Two reflections will evidently result in a linear transformation. We wish to investigate the geometric significance of symmetry. Suppose first that C is a straight line. Then we can choose za = oo and the condition for symmetry becomes
(10) z* - Z2 Z- Z2
Zl - Z2 Zl - Z2
Taking absolute values we obtain iz* - z2i = iz - z2iÂ· Here z2 can be
any finite point on C, and we conclude that z and z* are equidistant
from all points on C. By (lO)we have further
z*- Z2 Z- Z2
Im = -Im---,
Z1 - Z2 Z1 - Z2
and hence z and z* are in different half planes determined by C. t We
leave to the reader to prove that C is the bisecting normal of the segment between z and z*. Consider now the case of a finite circle C of center a and radius R.
Systematic use of the invariance of the cross ratio allows us to conclude as follows:
(z,z1,z2,za) = (z - a,z1 - a,z2 - a,z8 - a) ( - _ R2 R2 R2 ) ( R2 )
= z - a, - - - , - - - , - - = ----_, Z1 - a,z2 - a,z8 -a
Z1 - a Z2 - a za - a z - a
= (- R 2 _ + a,z1,z2,za)Â·
z-a
This equation shows that the symmetric point of z is z* = R 2j (z - a) + a
or that z and z* satisfy the relation
(11) (z* - a)(i - a) = R 2â¢
The product iz* - ai Â· iz - a\ of the distances to the center is hence R 2.
Further, the ratio (z* - a)j(z -a) is positive, which means that z and
z* are situated on the same half line from a. There is a simple geometric
construction for the symmetric point of z (Fig. 3-2). We note that the
symmetric point of a is oo.
t Unless they coincide and lie on C.

Theorem 15. (The symmetry principle.) If a linear transformation carries a circle CI into a circle c2, then it transforms any pair of symmetric points with respect to CI into a pair of symmetric points with respect to C2.
Briefly, linear transformations preserve symmetry. If CI or C2 is the real axis, the principle follows from the definition of symmetry. In the general case the assertion follows by use of an intermediate transformation which carries CI into the real axis. There are two ways in which the principle of symmetry can be used. If the images of z and C under a certain linear transformation are known, then the principle allows us to find the image of z*. On the other hand, if the images of z and z* are known, we conclude that the image of C must be a line of symmetry of these images. While this is not enough to determine the image of C, the information we gain is nevertheless valuable. The principle of symmetry is put to practical use in the problem of finding the linear transformations which carry a circle C into a circle C'. We can always determine the transformation by requiring that three points zi, z2, za on C go over into three points WI, W2, wa on C'; the trans
formation is then (w,wi,w 2,wa) = (z,zi,z2,z 3). But the transformation is
also determined if we prescribe that a point ZI on C shall correspond to a point WI on C' and that a point z2not on C shall be carried into a point w2 not on C'. We know then that zi (the symmetric point of Z2 with respect to C) must correspond to wf (the symmetric point of w2 with respect to C'). Hence the transformation will be obtained from the relation (w,w1,w2,w!} = (z,z1,z2,z:>.

8. Same problem for \z\ = 1 and x = 2.
3.4. Oriented Circles. Because S(z) is analytic and
, ad-be
S (z) = (ez + d)2 rf 0
the mapping w = S(z) is conformal for z rf - d/e and oo. It follows that a pair of intersecting circles are mapped on circles that include the same angle. In addition, the sense of an angle is preserved. From an intuitive point of view this means that right and left are preserved, but a more precise formulation is desirable. An orientation of a circle C is determined by an ordered triple of points z1,z2,za on C. With respect to this orientation a point z not on C is said to lie to the right of C if Im (z,z 1,z2,z3) > 0 and to the left of C is
Im (z,z 1,z2,z3) < 0 (this checks with everyday use because (i,1,0, oo) = i).
It is essential to show that there are only two different orientations. By this we mean that the distinction between left and right is the same for all triples, while the meaning may be reversed. Since the cross ratio is invariant, it is sufficient to consider the case where C is the real axis. Then
az + b
(z,z1,z2,za) = Cz + d
can be written with real coefficients, and a simple calculation gives
ad - be
Im (z,z1,z2,za) = \cz + d\ 2Im z.
We recognize that the distinction between right and left is the same as the distinction between the upper and lower half plane. Which is which depends on the sign of the determinant ad - be.


84 COMPLEX ANALYSIS
A linear transformation S carries the oriented circle C into a circle which we orient through the triple Szt, Sz2, Sz 3â¢ From the invariance of the cross ratio it follows that the left and right of C will be mapped on the left and right of the image circle. If two circles are tangent to each other, their orientations can be compared. Indeed, we can use a linear transformation which throws their common point to oo. The circles become parallel straight lines, and we know how to compare the directions of parallel lines. In the geometric representation the orientation z1, z2, z3 can be indicated by an arrow which points from z1 over z2 to z3. With the usual choice of the coordinate system left and right will have their customary meaning with respect to this arrow. When the finite plane is considered as part of the extended plane, the point at infinity is distinguished. We can therefore define an absolute positive orientation of all finite circles by the requirement that oo should lie to the right of the oriented circles. The points to the left are said to form the inside of the circle and the points to the right form its outside.
EXERCISES
1. If Zt, z2, z3, Z4 are points on a circle, show that z1, Z3, Z4 and z2, z3, Z4
determine the same orientation if and only if (z1,z2,z3,Z4) > 0. 2. Prove that a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact (in this connection a tangent should be defined as a straight line with only one point in common with the circle).
3. Verify that the inside of the circle \z - a\ = R is formed by all
points z with \z - a\ < R. 4. The angle between two oriented circles at a point of intersection is defined as the angle between the tangents at that point, equipped with the same orientation. Prove by analytic reasoning, rather than geometric inspection, that the angles at the two points of intersection are opposite to each other.
3.5. Families of Circles. A great deal can be done toward the visualization of linear transformations by the introduction of certain families of circles which may be thought of as coordinate lines in a circular coordinate system. Consider a linear transformation of the form
z-a
w = kÂ·--Â·
z- b
Here z = a corresponds to w = 0 and z = b tow = oo. It follows that the straight lines through the origin of the w-plane are images of the
