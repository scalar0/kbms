Preface
Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of “Big Data” problems, statistical learning has become a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand.
One of the first books in this area—The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)—was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statistics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL’s popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less technical treatment of these topics. In this new book, we cover many of the same topics as ESL, but we concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. We have created labs illustrating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master’s students in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other

Introduction
An Overview of Statistical Learning
Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. These tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and public policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data. To provide an illustration of some applications of statistical learning, we briefly discuss three real-world data sets that are considered in this book.
Wage Data
In this application (which we refer to as the Wage data set throughout this book), we examine a number of factors that relate to wages for a group of males from the Atlantic region of the United States. In particular, we wish to understand the association between an employee’s age and education, as well as the calendar year, on his wage. Consider, for example, the left-hand panel of Figure 1.1, which displays wage versus age for each of the individuals in the data set. There is evidence that wage increases with age but then decreases again after approximately age 60. The blue line, which provides an estimate of the average wage for a given age, makes this trend clearer.

FIGURE 1.1. Wage data, which contains income survey information for males from the central Atlantic region of the United States. Left: wage as a function of age. On average, wage increases with age until about 60 years of age, at which point it begins to decline. Center: wage as a function of year. There is a slow but steady increase of approximately $10,000 in the average wage between 2003 and 2009. Right: Boxplots displaying wage as a function of education, with 1 indicating the lowest level (no high school diploma) and 5 the highest level (an advanced graduate degree). On average, wage increases with the level of education.
Given an employee’s age, we can use this curve to predict his wage. However, it is also clear from Figure 1.1 that there is a significant amount of variability associated with this average value, and so age alone is unlikely to provide an accurate prediction of a particular man’s wage. We also have information regarding each employee’s education level and the year in which the wage was earned. The center and right-hand panels of Figure 1.1, which display wage as a function of both year and education, indicate that both of these factors are associated with wage. Wages increase by approximately $10,000, in a roughly linear (or straight-line) fashion, between 2003 and 2009, though this rise is very slight relative to the variability in the data. Wages are also typically greater for individuals with higher education levels: men with the lowest education level (1) tend to have substantially lower wages than those with the highest education level (5). Clearly, the most accurate prediction of a given man’s wage will be obtained by combining his age, his education, and the year. In Chapter 3, we discuss linear regression, which can be used to predict wage from this data set. Ideally, we should predict wage in a way that accounts for the non-linear relationship between wage and age. In Chapter 7, we discuss a class of approaches for addressing this problem.
Stock Market Data
The Wage data involves predicting a continuous or quantitative output value. This is often referred to as a regression problem. However, in certain cases we may instead wish to predict a non-numerical value—that is, a categorical

or qualitative output. For example, in Chapter 4 we examine a stock market data set that contains the daily movements in the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P) stock index over a 5-year period between 2001 and 2005. We refer to this as the Smarket data. The goal is to predict whether the index will increase or decrease on a given day using the past 5 days’ percentage changes in the index. Here the statistical learning problem does not involve predicting a numerical value. Instead it involves predicting whether a given day’s stock market performance will fall into the Up bucket or the Down bucket. This is known as a classification problem. A model that could accurately predict the direction in which the market will move would be very useful! The left-hand panel of Figure 1.2 displays two boxplots of the previous day’s percentage changes in the stock index: one for the 648 days for which the market increased on the subsequent day, and one for the 602 days for which the market decreased. The two plots look almost identical, suggesting that there is no simple strategy for using yesterday’s movement in the S&P to predict today’s returns. The remaining panels, which display boxplots for the percentage changes 2 and 3 days previous to today, similarly indicate little association between past and present returns. Of course, this lack of pattern is to be expected: in the presence of strong correlations between successive days’ returns, one could adopt a simple trading strategy to generate profits from the market. Nevertheless, in Chapter 4, we explore these data using several different statistical learning methods. Interestingly, there are hints of some weak trends in the data that suggest that, at least for this 5-year period, it is possible to correctly predict the direction of movement in the market approximately 60% of the time (Figure 1.3).

FIGURE 1.3. We fit a quadratic discriminant analysis model to the subset of the Smarket data corresponding to the 2001–2004 time period, and predicted the probability of a stock market decrease using the 2005 data. On average, the predicted probability of decrease is higher for the days in which the market does decrease. Based on these results, we are able to correctly predict the direction of movement in the market 60% of the time.
Gene Expression Data
The previous two applications illustrate data sets with both input and output variables. However, another important class of problems involves situations in which we only observe input variables, with no corresponding output. For example, in a marketing setting, we might have demographic information for a number of current or potential customers. We may wish to understand which types of customers are similar to each other by grouping individuals according to their observed characteristics. This is known as a clustering problem. Unlike in the previous examples, here we are not trying to predict an output variable. We devote Chapter 10 to a discussion of statistical learning methods for problems in which no natural output variable is available. We consider the NCI60 data set, which consists of 6,830 gene expression measurements for each of 64 cancer cell lines. Instead of predicting a particular output variable, we are interested in determining whether there are groups, or clusters, among the cell lines based on their gene expression measurements. This is a difficult question to address, in part because there are thousands of gene expression measurements per cell line, making it hard to visualize the data. The left-hand panel of Figure 1.4 addresses this problem by representing each of the 64 cell lines using just two numbers, Z1 and Z2. These are the first two principal components of the data, which summarize the 6, 830 expression measurements for each cell line down to two numbers or dimensions. While it is likely that this dimension reduction has resulted in

some loss of information, it is now possible to visually examine the data for evidence of clustering. Deciding on the number of clusters is often a difficult problem. But the left-hand panel of Figure 1.4 suggests at least four groups of cell lines, which we have represented using separate colors. We can now examine the cell lines within each cluster for similarities in their types of cancer, in order to better understand the relationship between gene expression levels and cancer. In this particular data set, it turns out that the cell lines correspond to 14 different types of cancer. (However, this information was not used to create the left-hand panel of Figure 1.4.) The right-hand panel of Figure 1.4 is identical to the left-hand panel, except that the 14 cancer types are shown using distinct colored symbols. There is clear evidence that cell lines with the same cancer type tend to be located near each other in this two-dimensional representation. In addition, even though the cancer information was not used to produce the left-hand panel, the clustering obtained does bear some resemblance to some of the actual cancer types observed in the right-hand panel. This provides some independent verification of the accuracy of our clustering analysis.
A Brief History of Statistical Learning
Though the term statistical learning is fairly new, many of the concepts that underlie the field were developed long ago. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Legendre and Gauss published papers on the method


6 1. Introduction
of least squares, which implemented the earliest form of what is now known as linear regression. The approach was first successfully applied to problems in astronomy. Linear regression is used for predicting quantitative values, such as an individual’s salary. In order to predict qualitative values, such as whether a patient survives or dies, or whether the stock market increases or decreases, Fisher proposed linear discriminant analysis in 1936. In the 1940s, various authors put forth an alternative approach, logistic regression. In the early 1970s, Nelder and Wedderburn coined the term generalized linear models for an entire class of statistical learning methods that include both linear and logistic regression as special cases. By the end of the 1970s, many more techniques for learning from data were available. However, they were almost exclusively linear methods, because fitting non-linear relationships was computationally infeasible at the time. By the 1980s, computing technology had finally improved sufficiently that non-linear methods were no longer computationally prohibitive. In mid 1980s Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and Stone introduced classification and regression trees, and were among the first to demonstrate the power of a detailed practical implementation of a method, including cross-validation for model selection. Hastie and Tibshirani coined the term generalized additive models in 1986 for a class of non-linear extensions to generalized linear models, and also provided a practical software implementation. Since that time, inspired by the advent of machine learning and other disciplines, statistical learning has emerged as a new subfield in statistics, focused on supervised and unsupervised modeling and prediction. In recent years, progress in statistical learning has been marked by the increasing availability of powerful and relatively user-friendly software, such as the popular and freely available R system. This has the potential to continue the transformation of the field from a set of techniques used and developed by statisticians and computer scientists to an essential toolkit for a much broader community.
This Book
The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman was first published in 2001. Since that time, it has become an important reference on the fundamentals of statistical machine learning. Its success derives from its comprehensive and detailed treatment of many important topics in statistical learning, as well as the fact that (relative to many upper-level statistics textbooks) it is accessible to a wide audience. However, the greatest factor behind the success of ESL has been its topical nature. At the time of its publication, interest in the field of statistical


1. Introduction 7
learning was starting to explode. ESL provided one of the first accessible and comprehensive introductions to the topic. Since ESL was first published, the field of statistical learning has continued to flourish. The field’s expansion has taken two forms. The most obvious growth has involved the development of new and improved statistical learning approaches aimed at answering a range of scientific questions across a number of fields. However, the field of statistical learning has also expanded its audience. In the 1990s, increases in computational power generated a surge of interest in the field from non-statisticians who were eager to use cutting-edge statistical tools to analyze their data. Unfortunately, the highly technical nature of these approaches meant that the user community remained primarily restricted to experts in statistics, computer science, and related fields with the training (and time) to understand and implement them. In recent years, new and improved software packages have significantly eased the implementation burden for many statistical learning methods. At the same time, there has been growing recognition across a number of fields, from business to health care to genetics to the social sciences and beyond, that statistical learning is a powerful tool with important practical applications. As a result, the field has moved from one of primarily academic interest to a mainstream discipline, with an enormous potential audience. This trend will surely continue with the increasing availability of enormous quantities of data and the software to analyze it.
The purpose of An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) is to facilitate the transition of statistical learning from an academic to a mainstream field. ISL is not intended to replace ESL, which is a far more comprehensive text both in terms of the number of approaches considered and the depth to which they are explored. We consider ESL to be an important companion for professionals (with graduate degrees in statistics, machine learning, or related fields) who need to understand the technical details behind statistical learning approaches. However, the community of users of statistical learning techniques has expanded to include individuals with a wider range of interests and backgrounds. Therefore, we believe that there is now a place for a less technical and more accessible version of ESL. In teaching these topics over the years, we have discovered that they are of interest to master’s and PhD students in fields as disparate as business administration, biology, and computer science, as well as to quantitativelyoriented upper-division undergraduates. It is important for this diverse group to be able to understand the models, intuitions, and strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches. But for this audience, many of the technical details behind statistical learning methods, such as optimization algorithms and theoretical properties, are not of primary interest. We believe that these students do not need a deep understanding of these aspects in order to become informed users of the various methodologies, and


8 1. Introduction
in order to contribute to their chosen fields through the use of statistical learning tools. ISLR is based on the following four premises.
1. Many statistical learning methods are relevant and useful in a wide range of academic and non-academic disciplines, beyond just the statistical sciences. We believe that many contemporary statistical learning procedures should, and will, become as widely available and used as is currently the case for classical methods such as linear regression. As a result, rather than attempting to consider every possible approach (an impossible task), we have concentrated on presenting the methods that we believe are most widely applicable.
2. Statistical learning should not be viewed as a series of black boxes. No single approach will perform well in all possible applications. Without understanding all of the cogs inside the box, or the interaction between those cogs, it is impossible to select the best box. Hence, we have attempted to carefully describe the model, intuition, assumptions, and trade-offs behind each of the methods that we consider.
3. While it is important to know what job is performed by each cog, it is not necessary to have the skills to construct the machine inside the box! Thus, we have minimized discussion of technical details related to fitting procedures and theoretical properties. We assume that the reader is comfortable with basic mathematical concepts, but we do not assume a graduate degree in the mathematical sciences. For instance, we have almost completely avoided the use of matrix algebra, and it is possible to understand the entire book without a detailed knowledge of matrices and vectors.
4. We presume that the reader is interested in applying statistical learning methods to real-world problems. In order to facilitate this, as well as to motivate the techniques discussed, we have devoted a section within each chapter to R computer labs. In each lab, we walk the reader through a realistic application of the methods considered in that chapter. When we have taught this material in our courses, we have allocated roughly one-third of classroom time to working through the labs, and we have found them to be extremely useful. Many of the less computationally-oriented students who were initially intimidated by R’s command level interface got the hang of things over the course of the quarter or semester. We have used R because it is freely available and is powerful enough to implement all of the methods discussed in the book. It also has optional packages that can be downloaded to implement literally thousands of additional methods. Most importantly, R is the language of choice for academic statisticians, and new approaches often become available in


1. Introduction 9
R years before they are implemented in commercial packages. However, the labs in ISL are self-contained, and can be skipped if the reader wishes to use a different software package or does not wish to apply the methods discussed to real-world problems.
Who Should Read This Book?
This book is intended for anyone who is interested in using modern statistical methods for modeling and prediction from data. This group includes scientists, engineers, data analysts, or quants, but also less technical individuals with degrees in non-quantitative fields such as the social sciences or business. We expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics. Background in linear regression is also useful, though not required, since we review the key concepts behind linear regression in Chapter 3. The mathematical level of this book is modest, and a detailed knowledge of matrix operations is not required. This book provides an introduction to the statistical programming language R. Previous exposure to a programming language, such as MATLAB or Python, is useful but not required. We have successfully taught material at this level to master’s and PhD students in business, computer science, biology, earth sciences, psychology, and many other areas of the physical and social sciences. This book could also be appropriate for advanced undergraduates who have already taken a course on linear regression. In the context of a more mathematically rigorous course in which ESL serves as the primary textbook, ISL could be used as a supplementary text for teaching computational aspects of the various approaches.
Notation and Simple Matrix Algebra
Choosing notation for a textbook is always a difficult task. For the most part we adopt the same notational conventions as ESL. We will use n to represent the number of distinct data points, or observations, in our sample. We will let p denote the number of variables that are available for use in making predictions. For example, the Wage data set consists of 12 variables for 3,000 people, so we have n = 3,000 observations and
this book, we indicate variable names using colored font: Variable Name. In some examples, p might be quite large, such as on the order of thousands or even millions; this situation arises quite often, for example, in the analysis of modern biological data or web-based advertising data.
p = 12 variables (such as year, age, sex, and more). Note that throughout


10 1. Introduction
In general, we will let xij represent the value of the jth variable for the ith observation, where i = 1, 2, . . . , n and j = 1, 2, . . . , p. Throughout this book, i will be used to index the samples or observations (from 1 to n) and j will be used to index the variables (from 1 to p). We let X denote a n × p matrix whose (i, j)th element is xij. That is,
X=
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
x11 x12 . . . x1p x21 x22 . . . x2p
... ... . . . ...
xn1 xn2 . . . xnp
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ .
For readers who are unfamiliar with matrices, it is useful to visualize X as a spreadsheet of numbers with n rows and p columns. At times we will be interested in the rows of X, which we write as x1, x2, . . . , xn. Here xi is a vector of length p, containing the p variable measurements for the ith observation. That is,
xi =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
xi1
xi2
...
xip
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ . (1.1)
(Vectors are by default represented as columns.) For example, for the Wage data, xi values for the ith individual. At other times we will instead be interested in the columns of X, which we write as x1, x2, . . . , xp. Each is a vector of length n. That is,
xj =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
x1j
x2j
...
xnj
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ .
For example, for the Wage data, x1 contains the n = 3,000 values for year. Using this notation, the matrix X can be written as
X = (x1 x2 · · · xp
),
or
X=
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
x1T
x...2T
xTn
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ .
is a vector of length 12, consisting of year, age, sex, and other


1. Introduction 11
The T notation denotes the transpose of a matrix or vector. So, for example,
XT =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
x11 x21 . . . xn1 x12 x22 . . . xn2
... ... ...
x1p x2p . . . xnp
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ ,
while
xT
i = (xi1 xi2 · · · xip
).
We use yi to denote the ith observation of the variable on which we wish to make predictions, such as wage. Hence, we write the set of all n observations in vector form as
y=
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
y1 y2
...
yn
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ .
Then our observed data consists of {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn)}, where each xi is a vector of length p. (If p = 1, then xi is simply a scalar.) In this text, a vector of length n will always be denoted in lower case bold ; e.g.
a=
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
a1 a2
...
an
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠ .
However, vectors that are not of length n (such as feature vectors of length p, as in (1.1)) will be denoted in lower case normal font, e.g. a. Scalars will also be denoted in lower case normal font, e.g. a. In the rare cases in which these two uses for lower case normal font lead to ambiguity, we will clarify which use is intended. Matrices will be denoted using bold capitals, such as A. Random variables will be denoted using capital normal font, e.g. A, regardless of their dimensions. Occasionally we will want to indicate the dimension of a particular object. To indicate that an object is a scalar, we will use the notation a ∈ R. To indicate that it is a vector of length k, we will use a ∈ Rk (or a ∈ Rn if it is of length n). We will indicate that an object is a r × s matrix using A ∈ Rr×s.
We have avoided using matrix algebra whenever possible. However, in a few instances it becomes too cumbersome to avoid it entirely. In these rare instances it is important to understand the concept of multiplying two matrices. Suppose that A ∈ Rr×d and B ∈ Rd×s. Then the product


12 1. Introduction
of A and B is denoted AB. The (i, j)th element of AB is computed by multiplying each element of the ith row of A by the corresponding element
of the jth column of B. That is, (AB)ij = ∑d
k=1 aikbkj . As an example, consider
A=
(1 2 34
)
and B =
(5 6 78
) .
Then
AB =
(1 2 34
) (5 6
78
) =
(1 × 5 + 2 × 7 1 × 6 + 2 × 8 3×5+4×7 3×6+4×8
) =
(19 22 43 50
) .
Note that this operation produces an r × s matrix. It is only possible to compute AB if the number of columns of A is the same as the number of rows of B.
Organization of This Book
Chapter 2 introduces the basic terminology and concepts behind statistical learning. This chapter also presents the K-nearest neighbor classifier, a very simple method that works surprisingly well on many problems. Chapters 3 and 4 cover classical linear methods for regression and classification. In particular, Chapter 3 reviews linear regression, the fundamental starting point for all regression methods. In Chapter 4 we discuss two of the most important classical classification methods, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.
A central problem in all statistical learning situations involves choosing the best method for a given application. Hence, in Chapter 5 we introduce cross-validation and the bootstrap, which can be used to estimate the accuracy of a number of different methods in order to choose the best one. Much of the recent research in statistical learning has concentrated on non-linear methods. However, linear methods often have advantages over their non-linear competitors in terms of interpretability and sometimes also accuracy. Hence, in Chapter 6 we consider a host of linear methods, both classical and more modern, which offer potential improvements over standard linear regression. These include stepwise selection, ridge regression, principal components regression, partial least squares, and the lasso.
The remaining chapters move into the world of non-linear statistical learning. We first introduce in Chapter 7 a number of non-linear methods that work well for problems with a single input variable. We then show how these methods can be used to fit non-linear additive models for which there is more than one input. In Chapter 8, we investigate tree-based methods, including bagging, boosting, and random forests. Support vector machines, a set of approaches for performing both linear and non-linear classification,


1. Introduction 13
are discussed in Chapter 9. Finally, in Chapter 10, we consider a setting in which we have input variables but no output variable. In particular, we present principal components analysis, K-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering.
At the end of each chapter, we present one or more R lab sections in which we systematically work through applications of the various methods discussed in that chapter. These labs demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches, and also provide a useful reference for the syntax required to implement the various methods. The reader may choose to work through the labs at his or her own pace, or the labs may be the focus of group sessions as part of a classroom environment. Within each R lab, we present the results that we obtained when we performed the lab at the time of writing this book. However, new versions of R are continuously released, and over time, the packages called in the labs will be updated. Therefore, in the future, it is possible that the results shown in the lab sections may no longer correspond precisely to the results obtained by the reader who performs the labs. As necessary, we will post updates to the labs on the book website.
We use the symbol to denote sections or exercises that contain more challenging concepts. These can be easily skipped by readers who do not wish to delve as deeply into the material, or who lack the mathematical background.
Data Sets Used in Labs and Exercises
In this textbook, we illustrate statistical learning methods using applications from marketing, finance, biology, and other areas. The ISLR package available on the book website contains a number of data sets that are required in order to perform the labs and exercises associated with this book. One other data set is contained in the MASS library, and yet another is part of the base R distribution. Table 1.1 contains a summary of the data sets required to perform the labs and exercises. A couple of these data sets are also available as text files on the book website, for use in Chapter 2.

Statistical Learning
2.1 What Is Statistical Learning?
In order to motivate our study of statistical learning, we begin with a simple example. Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to provide advice on how to improve sales of a particular product. The Advertising data set consists of the sales of that product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, radio, and newspaper. The data are displayed in Figure 2.1. It is not possible for our client to directly increase sales of the product. On the other hand, they can control the advertising expenditure in each of the three media. Therefore, if we determine that there is an association between advertising and sales, then we can instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly increasing sales. In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets. In this setting, the advertising budgets are input variables while sales input
variable
is an output variable. The input variables are typically denoted using the
output variable
symbol X, with a subscript to distinguish them. So X1 might be the TV budget, X2 the radio budget, and X3 the newspaper budget. The inputs
go by different names, such as predictors, independent variables, features, predictor
independent variable feature
or sometimes just variables. The output variable—in this case, sales—is
variable
often called the response or dependent variable, and is typically denoted
response
dependent variable
using the symbol Y . Throughout this book, we will use all of these terms interchangeably.

In each plot we show the simple least squares fit of sales to that variable, as described in Chapter 3. In other words, each blue line represents a simple model that can be used to predict sales using TV, radio, and newspaper, respectively.
More generally, suppose that we observe a quantitative response Y and p different predictors, X1, X2, . . . , Xp. We assume that there is some relationship between Y and X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xp), which can be written in the very general form
Y = f (X) + . (2.1)
Here f is some fixed but unknown function of X1, . . . , Xp, and is a random error term, which is independent of X and has mean zero. In this formula- error term
tion, f represents the systematic information that X provides about Y . systematic
As another example, consider the left-hand panel of Figure 2.2, a plot of income versus years of education for 30 individuals in the Income data set. The plot suggests that one might be able to predict income using years of education. However, the function f that connects the input variable to the output variable is in general unknown. In this situation one must estimate f based on the observed points. Since Income is a simulated data set, f is known and is shown by the blue curve in the right-hand panel of Figure 2.2. The vertical lines represent the error terms . We note that some of the 30 observations lie above the blue curve and some lie below it; overall, the errors have approximately mean zero. In general, the function f may involve more than one input variable. In Figure 2.3 we plot income as a function of years of education and seniority. Here f is a two-dimensional surface that must be estimated based on the observed data.

Right: The blue curve represents the true underlying relationship between income and years of education, which is generally unknown (but is known in this case because the data were simulated). The black lines represent the error associated with each observation. Note that some errors are positive (if an observation lies above the blue curve) and some are negative (if an observation lies below the curve). Overall, these errors have approximately mean zero.
In essence, statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f . In this chapter we outline some of the key theoretical concepts that arise in estimating f , as well as tools for evaluating the estimates obtained.
2.1.1 Why Estimate f ?
There are two main reasons that we may wish to estimate f : prediction and inference. We discuss each in turn.
Prediction
In many situations, a set of inputs X are readily available, but the output Y cannot be easily obtained. In this setting, since the error term averages to zero, we can predict Y using
Yˆ = fˆ(X), (2.2)
where fˆ represents our estimate for f , and Yˆ represents the resulting prediction for Y . In this setting, fˆ is often treated as a black box, in the sense that one is not typically concerned with the exact form of fˆ, provided that it yields accurate predictions for Y .

Income
FIGURE 2.3. The plot displays income as a function of years of education and seniority in the Income data set. The blue surface represents the true underlying relationship between income and years of education and seniority, which is known since the data are simulated. The red dots indicate the observed values of these quantities for 30 individuals.
As an example, suppose that X1, . . . , Xp are characteristics of a patient’s blood sample that can be easily measured in a lab, and Y is a variable encoding the patient’s risk for a severe adverse reaction to a particular drug. It is natural to seek to predict Y using X, since we can then avoid giving the drug in question to patients who are at high risk of an adverse reaction—that is, patients for whom the estimate of Y is high. The accuracy of Yˆ as a prediction for Y depends on two quantities, which we will call the reducible error and the irreducible error. In general, reducible
error irreducible error
fˆ will not be a perfect estimate for f , and this inaccuracy will introduce some error. This error is reducible because we can potentially improve the accuracy of fˆ by using the most appropriate statistical learning technique to estimate f . However, even if it were possible to form a perfect estimate for f , so that our estimated response took the form Yˆ = f (X), our prediction would still have some error in it! This is because Y is also a function of , which, by definition, cannot be predicted using X. Therefore, variability associated with also affects the accuracy of our predictions. This is known as the irreducible error, because no matter how well we estimate f , we cannot reduce the error introduced by . Why is the irreducible error larger than zero? The quantity may contain unmeasured variables that are useful in predicting Y : since we don’t measure them, f cannot use them for its prediction. The quantity may also contain unmeasurable variation. For example, the risk of an adverse reaction might vary for a given patient on a given day, depending on


2.1 What Is Statistical Learning? 19

The focus of this book is on techniques for estimating f with the aim of minimizing the reducible error. It is important to keep in mind that the irreducible error will always provide an upper bound on the accuracy of our prediction for Y . This bound is almost always unknown in practice.
Inference
We are often interested in understanding the way that Y is affected as X1, . . . , Xp change. In this situation we wish to estimate f , but our goal is not necessarily to make predictions for Y . We instead want to understand the relationship between X and Y , or more specifically, to understand how Y changes as a function of X1, . . . , Xp. Now fˆ cannot be treated as a black box, because we need to know its exact form. In this setting, one may be interested in answering the following questions:
• Which predictors are associated with the response? It is often the case that only a small fraction of the available predictors are substantially associated with Y . Identifying the few important predictors among a large set of possible variables can be extremely useful, depending on the application.
• What is the relationship between the response and each predictor? Some predictors may have a positive relationship with Y , in the sense that increasing the predictor is associated with increasing values of Y . Other predictors may have the opposite relationship. Depending on the complexity of f , the relationship between the response and a given predictor may also depend on the values of the other predictors.
• Can the relationship between Y and each predictor be adequately summarized using a linear equation, or is the relationship more complicated? Historically, most methods for estimating f have taken a linear form. In some situations, such an assumption is reasonable or even desirable. But often the true relationship is more complicated, in which case a linear model may not provide an accurate representation of the relationship between the input and output variables.


20 2. Statistical Learning
In this book, we will see a number of examples that fall into the prediction setting, the inference setting, or a combination of the two. For instance, consider a company that is interested in conducting a direct-marketing campaign. The goal is to identify individuals who will respond positively to a mailing, based on observations of demographic variables measured on each individual. In this case, the demographic variables serve as predictors, and response to the marketing campaign (either positive or negative) serves as the outcome. The company is not interested in obtaining a deep understanding of the relationships between each individual predictor and the response; instead, the company simply wants an accurate model to predict the response using the predictors. This is an example of modeling for prediction. In contrast, consider the Advertising data illustrated in Figure 2.1. One may be interested in answering questions such as:
– Which media contribute to sales?
– Which media generate the biggest boost in sales? or
– How much increase in sales is associated with a given increase in TV advertising?
This situation falls into the inference paradigm. Another example involves modeling the brand of a product that a customer might purchase based on variables such as price, store location, discount levels, competition price, and so forth. In this situation one might really be most interested in how each of the individual variables affects the probability of purchase. For instance, what effect will changing the price of a product have on sales? This is an example of modeling for inference. Finally, some modeling could be conducted both for prediction and inference. For example, in a real estate setting, one may seek to relate values of homes to inputs such as crime rate, zoning, distance from a river, air quality, schools, income level of community, size of houses, and so forth. In this case one might be interested in how the individual input variables affect the prices—that is, how much extra will a house be worth if it has a view of the river? This is an inference problem. Alternatively, one may simply be interested in predicting the value of a home given its characteristics: is this house under- or over-valued? This is a prediction problem.
Depending on whether our ultimate goal is prediction, inference, or a combination of the two, different methods for estimating f may be appropriate. For example, linear models allow for relatively simple and inter- linear model
pretable inference, but may not yield as accurate predictions as some other approaches. In contrast, some of the highly non-linear approaches that we discuss in the later chapters of this book can potentially provide quite accurate predictions for Y , but this comes at the expense of a less interpretable model for which inference is more challenging.


2.1 What Is Statistical Learning? 21
2.1.2 How Do We Estimate f ?
Throughout this book, we explore many linear and non-linear approaches for estimating f . However, these methods generally share certain characteristics. We provide an overview of these shared characteristics in this section. We will always assume that we have observed a set of n different data points. For example in Figure 2.2 we observed n = 30 data points. These observations are called the training data because we will use these training data
observations to train, or teach, our method how to estimate f . Let xij represent the value of the jth predictor, or input, for observation i, where i = 1, 2, . . . , n and j = 1, 2, . . . , p. Correspondingly, let yi represent the response variable for the ith observation. Then our training data consist of {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn)} where xi = (xi1, xi2, . . . , xip)T .
Our goal is to apply a statistical learning method to the training data in order to estimate the unknown function f . In other words, we want to find a function fˆ such that Y ≈ fˆ(X) for any observation (X, Y ). Broadly speaking, most statistical learning methods for this task can be characterized as either parametric or non-parametric. We now briefly discuss these parametric
nonparametric
two types of approaches.
Parametric Methods
Parametric methods involve a two-step model-based approach.
1. First, we make an assumption about the functional form, or shape, of f . For example, one very simple assumption is that f is linear in X: f (X) = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + . . . + βpXp. (2.4)
This is a linear model, which will be discussed extensively in Chapter 3. Once we have assumed that f is linear, the problem of estimating f is greatly simplified. Instead of having to estimate an entirely arbitrary p-dimensional function f (X), one only needs to estimate the p + 1 coefficients β0, β1, . . . , βp.
2. After a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the training data to fit or train the model. In the case of the linear model fit
train
(2.4), we need to estimate the parameters β0, β1, . . . , βp. That is, we want to find values of these parameters such that
Y ≈ β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + . . . + βpXp.
The most common approach to fitting the model (2.4) is referred to as (ordinary) least squares, which we discuss in Chapter 3. However, least squares
least squares is one of many possible ways to fit the linear model. In Chapter 6, we discuss other approaches for estimating the parameters in (2.4).
The model-based approach just described is referred to as parametric; it reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of estimating a set of

parameters. Assuming a parametric form for f simplifies the problem of estimating f because it is generally much easier to estimate a set of parameters, such as β0, β1, . . . , βp in the linear model (2.4), than it is to fit an entirely arbitrary function f . The potential disadvantage of a parametric approach is that the model we choose will usually not match the true unknown form of f . If the chosen model is too far from the true f , then our estimate will be poor. We can try to address this problem by choosing flexible models that can fit many different possible functional forms flexible
for f . But in general, fitting a more flexible model requires estimating a greater number of parameters. These more complex models can lead to a phenomenon known as overfitting the data, which essentially means they overfitting
follow the errors, or noise, too closely. These issues are discussed through- noise
out this book. Figure 2.4 shows an example of the parametric approach applied to the Income data from Figure 2.3. We have fit a linear model of the form
income ≈ β0 + β1 × education + β2 × seniority.
Since we have assumed a linear relationship between the response and the two predictors, the entire fitting problem reduces to estimating β0, β1, and β2, which we do using least squares linear regression. Comparing Figure 2.3 to Figure 2.4, we can see that the linear fit given in Figure 2.4 is not quite right: the true f has some curvature that is not captured in the linear fit. However, the linear fit still appears to do a reasonable job of capturing the positive relationship between years of education and income, as well as the

slightly less positive relationship between seniority and income. It may be that with such a small number of observations, this is the best we can do.
Non-parametric Methods
Non-parametric methods do not make explicit assumptions about the functional form of f . Instead they seek an estimate of f that gets as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly. Such approaches can have a major advantage over parametric approaches: by avoiding the assumption of a particular functional form for f , they have the potential to accurately fit a wider range of possible shapes for f . Any parametric approach brings with it the possibility that the functional form used to estimate f is very different from the true f , in which case the resulting model will not fit the data well. In contrast, non-parametric approaches completely avoid this danger, since essentially no assumption about the form of f is made. But non-parametric approaches do suffer from a major disadvantage: since they do not reduce the problem of estimating f to a small number of parameters, a very large number of observations (far more than is typically needed for a parametric approach) is required in order to obtain an accurate estimate for f . An example of a non-parametric approach to fitting the Income data is shown in Figure 2.5. A thin-plate spline is used to estimate f . This ap- thin-plate
spline
proach does not impose any pre-specified model on f . It instead attempts to produce an estimate for f that is as close as possible to the observed data, subject to the fit—that is, the yellow surface in Figure 2.5—being

smooth. In this case, the non-parametric fit has produced a remarkably accurate estimate of the true f shown in Figure 2.3. In order to fit a thin-plate spline, the data analyst must select a level of smoothness. Figure 2.6 shows the same thin-plate spline fit using a lower level of smoothness, allowing for a rougher fit. The resulting estimate fits the observed data perfectly! However, the spline fit shown in Figure 2.6 is far more variable than the true function f , from Figure 2.3. This is an example of overfitting the data, which we discussed previously. It is an undesirable situation because the fit obtained will not yield accurate estimates of the response on new observations that were not part of the original training data set. We discuss methods for choosing the correct amount of smoothness in Chapter 5. Splines are discussed in Chapter 7. As we have seen, there are advantages and disadvantages to parametric and non-parametric methods for statistical learning. We explore both types of methods throughout this book.
2.1.3 The Trade-Off Between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability
Of the many methods that we examine in this book, some are less flexible, or more restrictive, in the sense that they can produce just a relatively small range of shapes to estimate f . For example, linear regression is a relatively inflexible approach, because it can only generate linear functions such as the lines shown in Figure 2.1 or the plane shown in Figure 2.4.

FIGURE 2.7. A representation of the tradeoff between flexibility and interpretability, using different statistical learning methods. In general, as the flexibility of a method increases, its interpretability decreases.
Other methods, such as the thin plate splines shown in Figures 2.5 and 2.6, are considerably more flexible because they can generate a much wider range of possible shapes to estimate f . One might reasonably ask the following question: why would we ever choose to use a more restrictive method instead of a very flexible approach? There are several reasons that we might prefer a more restrictive model. If we are mainly interested in inference, then restrictive models are much more interpretable. For instance, when inference is the goal, the linear model may be a good choice since it will be quite easy to understand the relationship between Y and X1, X2, . . . , Xp. In contrast, very flexible approaches, such as the splines discussed in Chapter 7 and displayed in Figures 2.5 and 2.6, and the boosting methods discussed in Chapter 8, can lead to such complicated estimates of f that it is difficult to understand how any individual predictor is associated with the response. Figure 2.7 provides an illustration of the trade-off between flexibility and interpretability for some of the methods that we cover in this book. Least squares linear regression, discussed in Chapter 3, is relatively inflexible but is quite interpretable. The lasso, discussed in Chapter 6, relies upon the lasso
linear model (2.4) but uses an alternative fitting procedure for estimating the coefficients β0, β1, . . . , βp. The new procedure is more restrictive in estimating the coefficients, and sets a number of them to exactly zero. Hence in this sense the lasso is a less flexible approach than linear regression. It is also more interpretable than linear regression, because in the final model the response variable will only be related to a small subset of the predictors—namely, those with nonzero coefficient estimates. Generalized


26 2. Statistical Learning
additive models (GAMs), discussed in Chapter 7, instead extend the lin- generalized
additive model
ear model (2.4) to allow for certain non-linear relationships. Consequently, GAMs are more flexible than linear regression. They are also somewhat less interpretable than linear regression, because the relationship between each predictor and the response is now modeled using a curve. Finally, fully
non-linear methods such as bagging, boosting, and support vector machines bagging
boosting
with non-linear kernels, discussed in Chapters 8 and 9, are highly flexible
support vector machine
approaches that are harder to interpret. We have established that when inference is the goal, there are clear advantages to using simple and relatively inflexible statistical learning methods. In some settings, however, we are only interested in prediction, and the interpretability of the predictive model is simply not of interest. For instance, if we seek to develop an algorithm to predict the price of a stock, our sole requirement for the algorithm is that it predict accuratelyinterpretability is not a concern. In this setting, we might expect that it will be best to use the most flexible model available. Surprisingly, this is not always the case! We will often obtain more accurate predictions using a less flexible method. This phenomenon, which may seem counterintuitive at first glance, has to do with the potential for overfitting in highly flexible methods. We saw an example of overfitting in Figure 2.6. We will discuss this very important concept further in Section 2.2 and throughout this book.
2.1.4 Supervised Versus Unsupervised Learning
Most statistical learning problems fall into one of two categories: supervised supervised
or unsupervised. The examples that we have discussed so far in this chap- unsupervised
ter all fall into the supervised learning domain. For each observation of the predictor measurement(s) xi, i = 1, . . . , n there is an associated response measurement yi. We wish to fit a model that relates the response to the predictors, with the aim of accurately predicting the response for future observations (prediction) or better understanding the relationship between the response and the predictors (inference). Many classical statistical learning methods such as linear regression and logistic regression (Chapter 4), as logistic
regression
well as more modern approaches such as GAM, boosting, and support vector machines, operate in the supervised learning domain. The vast majority of this book is devoted to this setting. In contrast, unsupervised learning describes the somewhat more challenging situation in which for every observation i = 1, . . . , n, we observe a vector of measurements xi but no associated response yi. It is not possible to fit a linear regression model, since there is no response variable to predict. In this setting, we are in some sense working blind; the situation is referred to as unsupervised because we lack a response variable that can supervise our analysis. What sort of statistical analysis is

possible? We can seek to understand the relationships between the variables or between the observations. One statistical learning tool that we may use in this setting is cluster analysis, or clustering. The goal of cluster analysis cluster
analysis
is to ascertain, on the basis of x1, . . . , xn, whether the observations fall into relatively distinct groups. For example, in a market segmentation study we might observe multiple characteristics (variables) for potential customers, such as zip code, family income, and shopping habits. We might believe that the customers fall into different groups, such as big spenders versus low spenders. If the information about each customer’s spending patterns were available, then a supervised analysis would be possible. However, this information is not available—that is, we do not know whether each potential customer is a big spender or not. In this setting, we can try to cluster the customers on the basis of the variables measured, in order to identify distinct groups of potential customers. Identifying such groups can be of interest because it might be that the groups differ with respect to some property of interest, such as spending habits. Figure 2.8 provides a simple illustration of the clustering problem. We have plotted 150 observations with measurements on two variables, X1 and X2. Each observation corresponds to one of three distinct groups. For illustrative purposes, we have plotted the members of each group using different colors and symbols. However, in practice the group memberships are unknown, and the goal is to determine the group to which each observation belongs. In the left-hand panel of Figure 2.8, this is a relatively easy task because the groups are well-separated. In contrast, the right-hand panel illustrates a more challenging problem in which there is some overlap


28 2. Statistical Learning
between the groups. A clustering method could not be expected to assign all of the overlapping points to their correct group (blue, green, or orange). In the examples shown in Figure 2.8, there are only two variables, and so one can simply visually inspect the scatterplots of the observations in order to identify clusters. However, in practice, we often encounter data sets that contain many more than two variables. In this case, we cannot easily plot the observations. For instance, if there are p variables in our data set, then p(p − 1)/2 distinct scatterplots can be made, and visual inspection is simply not a viable way to identify clusters. For this reason, automated clustering methods are important. We discuss clustering and other unsupervised learning approaches in Chapter 10. Many problems fall naturally into the supervised or unsupervised learning paradigms. However, sometimes the question of whether an analysis should be considered supervised or unsupervised is less clear-cut. For instance, suppose that we have a set of n observations. For m of the observations, where m < n, we have both predictor measurements and a response measurement. For the remaining n − m observations, we have predictor measurements but no response measurement. Such a scenario can arise if the predictors can be measured relatively cheaply but the corresponding responses are much more expensive to collect. We refer to this setting as a semi-supervised learning problem. In this setting, we wish to use a sta- semi
supervised learning
tistical learning method that can incorporate the m observations for which response measurements are available as well as the n − m observations for which they are not. Although this is an interesting topic, it is beyond the scope of this book.
2.1.5 Regression Versus Classification Problems
Variables can be characterized as either quantitative or qualitative (also quantitative
qualitative
known as categorical). Quantitative variables take on numerical values.
categorical
Examples include a person’s age, height, or income, the value of a house, and the price of a stock. In contrast, qualitative variables take on values in one of K different classes, or categories. Examples of qualitative class
variables include a person’s gender (male or female), the brand of product purchased (brand A, B, or C), whether a person defaults on a debt (yes or no), or a cancer diagnosis (Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or No Leukemia). We tend to refer to problems with a quantitative response as regression problems, while those involv- regression
ing a qualitative response are often referred to as classification problems. classification
However, the distinction is not always that crisp. Least squares linear regression (Chapter 3) is used with a quantitative response, whereas logistic regression (Chapter 4) is typically used with a qualitative (two-class, or binary) response. As such it is often used as a classification method. But binary
since it estimates class probabilities, it can be thought of as a regression


2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy 29
method as well. Some statistical methods, such as K-nearest neighbors (Chapters 2 and 4) and boosting (Chapter 8), can be used in the case of either quantitative or qualitative responses. We tend to select statistical learning methods on the basis of whether the response is quantitative or qualitative; i.e. we might use linear regression when quantitative and logistic regression when qualitative. However, whether the predictors are qualitative or quantitative is generally considered less important. Most of the statistical learning methods discussed in this book can be applied regardless of the predictor variable type, provided that any qualitative predictors are properly coded before the analysis is performed. This is discussed in Chapter 3.
2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy
One of the key aims of this book is to introduce the reader to a wide range of statistical learning methods that extend far beyond the standard linear regression approach. Why is it necessary to introduce so many different statistical learning approaches, rather than just a single best method? There is no free lunch in statistics: no one method dominates all others over all possible data sets. On a particular data set, one specific method may work best, but some other method may work better on a similar but different data set. Hence it is an important task to decide for any given set of data which method produces the best results. Selecting the best approach can be one of the most challenging parts of performing statistical learning in practice. In this section, we discuss some of the most important concepts that arise in selecting a statistical learning procedure for a specific data set. As the book progresses, we will explain how the concepts presented here can be applied in practice.
2.2.1 Measuring the Quality of Fit
In order to evaluate the performance of a statistical learning method on a given data set, we need some way to measure how well its predictions actually match the observed data. That is, we need to quantify the extent to which the predicted response value for a given observation is close to the true response value for that observation. In the regression setting, the most commonly-used measure is the mean squared error (MSE), given by mean
squared error
MSE = 1
n
∑n
i=1
(yi − fˆ(xi))2, (2.5)


30 2. Statistical Learning
where fˆ(xi) is the prediction that fˆ gives for the ith observation. The MSE will be small if the predicted responses are very close to the true responses, and will be large if for some of the observations, the predicted and true responses differ substantially. The MSE in (2.5) is computed using the training data that was used to fit the model, and so should more accurately be referred to as the training MSE. But in general, we do not really care how well the method works training
MSE
on the training data. Rather, we are interested in the accuracy of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously unseen
test data. Why is this what we care about? Suppose that we are interested test data
in developing an algorithm to predict a stock’s price based on previous stock returns. We can train the method using stock returns from the past 6 months. But we don’t really care how well our method predicts last week’s stock price. We instead care about how well it will predict tomorrow’s price or next month’s price. On a similar note, suppose that we have clinical measurements (e.g. weight, blood pressure, height, age, family history of disease) for a number of patients, as well as information about whether each patient has diabetes. We can use these patients to train a statistical learning method to predict risk of diabetes based on clinical measurements. In practice, we want this method to accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients based on their clinical measurements. We are not very interested in whether or not the method accurately predicts diabetes risk for patients used to train the model, since we already know which of those patients have diabetes. To state it more mathematically, suppose that we fit our statistical learning method on our training observations {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn)}, and we obtain the estimate fˆ. We can then compute fˆ(x1), fˆ(x2), . . . , fˆ(xn). If these are approximately equal to y1, y2, . . . , yn, then the training MSE given by (2.5) is small. However, we are really not interested in whether fˆ(xi) ≈ yi; instead, we want to know whether fˆ(x0) is approximately equal to y0, where (x0, y0) is a previously unseen test observation not used to train the statistical learning method. We want to choose the method that gives the lowest test MSE, as opposed to the lowest training MSE. In other words, test MSE
if we had a large number of test observations, we could compute
Ave(y0 − fˆ(x0))2, (2.6)
the average squared prediction error for these test observations (x0, y0). We’d like to select the model for which the average of this quantity—the test MSE—is as small as possible. How can we go about trying to select a method that minimizes the test MSE? In some settings, we may have a test data set available—that is, we may have access to a set of observations that were not used to train the statistical learning method. We can then simply evaluate (2.6) on the test observations, and select the learning method for which the test MSE is

FIGURE 2.9. Left: Data simulated from f , shown in black. Three estimates of f are shown: the linear regression line (orange curve), and two smoothing spline fits (blue and green curves). Right: Training MSE (grey curve), test MSE (red curve), and minimum possible test MSE over all methods (dashed line). Squares represent the training and test MSEs for the three fits shown in the left-hand panel.
smallest. But what if no test observations are available? In that case, one might imagine simply selecting a statistical learning method that minimizes the training MSE (2.5). This seems like it might be a sensible approach, since the training MSE and the test MSE appear to be closely related. Unfortunately, there is a fundamental problem with this strategy: there is no guarantee that the method with the lowest training MSE will also have the lowest test MSE. Roughly speaking, the problem is that many statistical methods specifically estimate coefficients so as to minimize the training set MSE. For these methods, the training set MSE can be quite small, but the test MSE is often much larger. Figure 2.9 illustrates this phenomenon on a simple example. In the lefthand panel of Figure 2.9, we have generated observations from (2.1) with the true f given by the black curve. The orange, blue and green curves illustrate three possible estimates for f obtained using methods with increasing levels of flexibility. The orange line is the linear regression fit, which is relatively inflexible. The blue and green curves were produced using smoothing splines, discussed in Chapter 7, with different levels of smoothness. It is smoothing
spline
clear that as the level of flexibility increases, the curves fit the observed data more closely. The green curve is the most flexible and matches the data very well; however, we observe that it fits the true f (shown in black) poorly because it is too wiggly. By adjusting the level of flexibility of the smoothing spline fit, we can produce many different fits to this data.


32 2. Statistical Learning
We now move on to the right-hand panel of Figure 2.9. The grey curve displays the average training MSE as a function of flexibility, or more formally the degrees of freedom, for a number of smoothing splines. The de- degrees of
freedom
grees of freedom is a quantity that summarizes the flexibility of a curve; it is discussed more fully in Chapter 7. The orange, blue and green squares indicate the MSEs associated with the corresponding curves in the lefthand panel. A more restricted and hence smoother curve has fewer degrees of freedom than a wiggly curve—note that in Figure 2.9, linear regression is at the most restrictive end, with two degrees of freedom. The training MSE declines monotonically as flexibility increases. In this example the true f is non-linear, and so the orange linear fit is not flexible enough to estimate f well. The green curve has the lowest training MSE of all three methods, since it corresponds to the most flexible of the three curves fit in the left-hand panel. In this example, we know the true function f , and so we can also compute the test MSE over a very large test set, as a function of flexibility. (Of course, in general f is unknown, so this will not be possible.) The test MSE is displayed using the red curve in the right-hand panel of Figure 2.9. As with the training MSE, the test MSE initially declines as the level of flexibility increases. However, at some point the test MSE levels off and then starts to increase again. Consequently, the orange and green curves both have high test MSE. The blue curve minimizes the test MSE, which should not be surprising given that visually it appears to estimate f the best in the left-hand panel of Figure 2.9. The horizontal dashed line indicates Var( ), the irreducible error in (2.3), which corresponds to the lowest achievable test MSE among all possible methods. Hence, the smoothing spline represented by the blue curve is close to optimal. In the right-hand panel of Figure 2.9, as the flexibility of the statistical learning method increases, we observe a monotone decrease in the training MSE and a U-shape in the test MSE. This is a fundamental property of statistical learning that holds regardless of the particular data set at hand and regardless of the statistical method being used. As model flexibility increases, training MSE will decrease, but the test MSE may not. When a given method yields a small training MSE but a large test MSE, we are said to be overfitting the data. This happens because our statistical learning procedure is working too hard to find patterns in the training data, and may be picking up some patterns that are just caused by random chance rather than by true properties of the unknown function f . When we overfit the training data, the test MSE will be very large because the supposed patterns that the method found in the training data simply don’t exist in the test data. Note that regardless of whether or not overfitting has occurred, we almost always expect the training MSE to be smaller than the test MSE because most statistical learning methods either directly or indirectly seek to minimize the training MSE. Overfitting refers specifically to the case in which a less flexible model would have yielded a smaller test MSE.

FIGURE 2.10. Details are as in Figure 2.9, using a different true f that is much closer to linear. In this setting, linear regression provides a very good fit to the data.
Figure 2.10 provides another example in which the true f is approximately linear. Again we observe that the training MSE decreases monotonically as the model flexibility increases, and that there is a U-shape in the test MSE. However, because the truth is close to linear, the test MSE only decreases slightly before increasing again, so that the orange least squares fit is substantially better than the highly flexible green curve. Finally, Figure 2.11 displays an example in which f is highly non-linear. The training and test MSE curves still exhibit the same general patterns, but now there is a rapid decrease in both curves before the test MSE starts to increase slowly. In practice, one can usually compute the training MSE with relative ease, but estimating test MSE is considerably more difficult because usually no test data are available. As the previous three examples illustrate, the flexibility level corresponding to the model with the minimal test MSE can vary considerably among data sets. Throughout this book, we discuss a variety of approaches that can be used in practice to estimate this minimum point. One important method is cross-validation (Chapter 5), which is a cross
validation
method for estimating test MSE using the training data.
2.2.2 The Bias-Variance Trade-Off
The U-shape observed in the test MSE curves (Figures 2.9–2.11) turns out to be the result of two competing properties of statistical learning methods. Though the mathematical proof is beyond the scope of this book, it is possible to show that the expected test MSE, for a given value x0, can

always be decomposed into the sum of three fundamental quantities: the variance of fˆ(x0), the squared bias of fˆ(x0) and the variance of the error variance
bias
terms . That is,
E
(
y0 − fˆ(x0)
)2
= Var(fˆ(x0)) + [Bias(fˆ(x0))]2 + Var( ). (2.7)
Here the notation E
(
y0 − fˆ(x0)
)2
defines the expected test MSE, and refers expected
test MSE
to the average test MSE that we would obtain if we repeatedly estimated f using a large number of training sets, and tested each at x0. The overall
expected test MSE can be computed by averaging E
(
y0 − fˆ(x0)
)2
over all
possible values of x0 in the test set. Equation 2.7 tells us that in order to minimize the expected test error, we need to select a statistical learning method that simultaneously achieves low variance and low bias. Note that variance is inherently a nonnegative quantity, and squared bias is also nonnegative. Hence, we see that the expected test MSE can never lie below Var( ), the irreducible error from (2.3). What do we mean by the variance and bias of a statistical learning method? Variance refers to the amount by which fˆ would change if we estimated it using a different training data set. Since the training data are used to fit the statistical learning method, different training data sets will result in a different fˆ. But ideally the estimate for f should not vary too much between training sets. However, if a method has high variance then small changes in the training data can result in large changes in fˆ. In general, more flexible statistical methods have higher variance. Consider the


2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy 35
green and orange curves in Figure 2.9. The flexible green curve is following the observations very closely. It has high variance because changing any one of these data points may cause the estimate fˆ to change considerably. In contrast, the orange least squares line is relatively inflexible and has low variance, because moving any single observation will likely cause only a small shift in the position of the line. On the other hand, bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model. For example, linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between Y and X1, X2, . . . , Xp. It is unlikely that any real-life problem truly has such a simple linear relationship, and so performing linear regression will undoubtedly result in some bias in the estimate of f . In Figure 2.11, the true f is substantially non-linear, so no matter how many training observations we are given, it will not be possible to produce an accurate estimate using linear regression. In other words, linear regression results in high bias in this example. However, in Figure 2.10 the true f is very close to linear, and so given enough data, it should be possible for linear regression to produce an accurate estimate. Generally, more flexible methods result in less bias. As a general rule, as we use more flexible methods, the variance will increase and the bias will decrease. The relative rate of change of these two quantities determines whether the test MSE increases or decreases. As we increase the flexibility of a class of methods, the bias tends to initially decrease faster than the variance increases. Consequently, the expected test MSE declines. However, at some point increasing flexibility has little impact on the bias but starts to significantly increase the variance. When this happens the test MSE increases. Note that we observed this pattern of decreasing test MSE followed by increasing test MSE in the right-hand panels of Figures 2.9–2.11. The three plots in Figure 2.12 illustrate Equation 2.7 for the examples in Figures 2.9–2.11. In each case the blue solid curve represents the squared bias, for different levels of flexibility, while the orange curve corresponds to the variance. The horizontal dashed line represents Var( ), the irreducible error. Finally, the red curve, corresponding to the test set MSE, is the sum of these three quantities. In all three cases, the variance increases and the bias decreases as the method’s flexibility increases. However, the flexibility level corresponding to the optimal test MSE differs considerably among the three data sets, because the squared bias and variance change at different rates in each of the data sets. In the left-hand panel of Figure 2.12, the bias initially decreases rapidly, resulting in an initial sharp decrease in the expected test MSE. On the other hand, in the center panel of Figure 2.12 the true f is close to linear, so there is only a small decrease in bias as flexibility increases, and the test MSE only declines slightly before increasing rapidly as the variance increases. Finally, in the right-hand panel of Figure 2.12, as flexibility increases, there is a dramatic decline in bias because

the true f is very non-linear. There is also very little increase in variance as flexibility increases. Consequently, the test MSE declines substantially before experiencing a small increase as model flexibility increases. The relationship between bias, variance, and test set MSE given in Equation 2.7 and displayed in Figure 2.12 is referred to as the bias-variance trade-off. Good test set performance of a statistical learning method re- bias-variance
trade-off
quires low variance as well as low squared bias. This is referred to as a trade-off because it is easy to obtain a method with extremely low bias but high variance (for instance, by drawing a curve that passes through every single training observation) or a method with very low variance but high bias (by fitting a horizontal line to the data). The challenge lies in finding a method for which both the variance and the squared bias are low. This trade-off is one of the most important recurring themes in this book. In a real-life situation in which f is unobserved, it is generally not possible to explicitly compute the test MSE, bias, or variance for a statistical learning method. Nevertheless, one should always keep the bias-variance trade-off in mind. In this book we explore methods that are extremely flexible and hence can essentially eliminate bias. However, this does not guarantee that they will outperform a much simpler method such as linear regression. To take an extreme example, suppose that the true f is linear. In this situation linear regression will have no bias, making it very hard for a more flexible method to compete. In contrast, if the true f is highly non-linear and we have an ample number of training observations, then we may do better using a highly flexible approach, as in Figure 2.11. In Chapter 5 we discuss cross-validation, which is a way to estimate the test MSE using the training data.


2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy 37
2.2.3 The Classification Setting
Thus far, our discussion of model accuracy has been focused on the regression setting. But many of the concepts that we have encountered, such as the bias-variance trade-off, transfer over to the classification setting with only some modifications due to the fact that yi is no longer numerical. Suppose that we seek to estimate f on the basis of training observations {(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)}, where now y1, . . . , yn are qualitative. The most common approach for quantifying the accuracy of our estimate fˆ is the training error rate, the proportion of mistakes that are made if we apply error rate
our estimate fˆ to the training observations:
1 n
∑n
i=1
I(yi = yˆi). (2.8)
Here yˆi is the predicted class label for the ith observation using fˆ. And I(yi = yˆi) is an indicator variable that equals 1 if yi = yˆi and zero if yi = yˆi. indicator
variable
If I(yi = yˆi) = 0 then the ith observation was classified correctly by our classification method; otherwise it was misclassified. Hence Equation 2.8 computes the fraction of incorrect classifications. Equation 2.8 is referred to as the training error rate because it is com- training
error
puted based on the data that was used to train our classifier. As in the regression setting, we are most interested in the error rates that result from applying our classifier to test observations that were not used in training. The test error rate associated with a set of test observations of the form test error
(x0, y0) is given by Ave (I(y0 = yˆ0)) , (2.9)
where yˆ0 is the predicted class label that results from applying the classifier to the test observation with predictor x0. A good classifier is one for which the test error (2.9) is smallest.
The Bayes Classifier
It is possible to show (though the proof is outside of the scope of this book) that the test error rate given in (2.9) is minimized, on average, by a very simple classifier that assigns each observation to the most likely class, given its predictor values. In other words, we should simply assign a test observation with predictor vector x0 to the class j for which
Pr(Y = j|X = x0) (2.10)
is largest. Note that (2.10) is a conditional probability: it is the probability conditional
probability
that Y = j, given the observed predictor vector x0. This very simple classifier is called the Bayes classifier. In a two-class problem where there are Bayes
classifier
only two possible response values, say class 1 or class 2, the Bayes classifier

corresponds to predicting class one if Pr(Y = 1|X = x0) > 0.5, and class two otherwise. Figure 2.13 provides an example using a simulated data set in a twodimensional space consisting of predictors X1 and X2. The orange and blue circles correspond to training observations that belong to two different classes. For each value of X1 and X2, there is a different probability of the response being orange or blue. Since this is simulated data, we know how the data were generated and we can calculate the conditional probabilities for each value of X1 and X2. The orange shaded region reflects the set of points for which Pr(Y = orange|X) is greater than 50 %, while the blue shaded region indicates the set of points for which the probability is below 50 %. The purple dashed line represents the points where the probability is exactly 50 %. This is called the Bayes decision boundary. The Bayes Bayes
decision boundary
classifier’s prediction is determined by the Bayes decision boundary; an observation that falls on the orange side of the boundary will be assigned to the orange class, and similarly an observation on the blue side of the boundary will be assigned to the blue class. The Bayes classifier produces the lowest possible test error rate, called the Bayes error rate. Since the Bayes classifier will always choose the class Bayes error
rate
for which (2.10) is largest, the error rate at X = x0 will be 1−maxj Pr(Y = j|X = x0). In general, the overall Bayes error rate is given by
1−E
(
mjax Pr(Y = j|X)
)
, (2.11)


2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy 39
where the expectation averages the probability over all possible values of X. For our simulated data, the Bayes error rate is 0.1304. It is greater than zero, because the classes overlap in the true population so maxj Pr(Y = j|X = x0) < 1 for some values of x0. The Bayes error rate is analogous to the irreducible error, discussed earlier.
K-Nearest Neighbors
In theory we would always like to predict qualitative responses using the Bayes classifier. But for real data, we do not know the conditional distribution of Y given X, and so computing the Bayes classifier is impossible. Therefore, the Bayes classifier serves as an unattainable gold standard against which to compare other methods. Many approaches attempt to estimate the conditional distribution of Y given X, and then classify a given observation to the class with highest estimated probability. One such method is the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier. Given a positive in- K-nearest
neighbors
teger K and a test observation x0, the KNN classifier first identifies the K points in the training data that are closest to x0, represented by N0. It then estimates the conditional probability for class j as the fraction of points in N0 whose response values equal j:
Pr(Y = j|X = x0) = 1
K
∑
i∈N0
I(yi = j). (2.12)
Finally, KNN applies Bayes rule and classifies the test observation x0 to the class with the largest probability. Figure 2.14 provides an illustrative example of the KNN approach. In the left-hand panel, we have plotted a small training data set consisting of six blue and six orange observations. Our goal is to make a prediction for the point labeled by the black cross. Suppose that we choose K = 3. Then KNN will first identify the three observations that are closest to the cross. This neighborhood is shown as a circle. It consists of two blue points and one orange point, resulting in estimated probabilities of 2/3 for the blue class and 1/3 for the orange class. Hence KNN will predict that the black cross belongs to the blue class. In the right-hand panel of Figure 2.14 we have applied the KNN approach with K = 3 at all of the possible values for X1 and X2, and have drawn in the corresponding KNN decision boundary. Despite the fact that it is a very simple approach, KNN can often produce classifiers that are surprisingly close to the optimal Bayes classifier. Figure 2.15 displays the KNN decision boundary, using K = 10, when applied to the larger simulated data set from Figure 2.13. Notice that even though the true distribution is not known by the KNN classifier, the KNN decision boundary is very close to that of the Bayes classifier. The test error rate using KNN is 0.1363, which is close to the Bayes error rate of 0.1304.

FIGURE 2.14. The KNN approach, using K = 3, is illustrated in a simple situation with six blue observations and six orange observations. Left: a test observation at which a predicted class label is desired is shown as a black cross. The three closest points to the test observation are identified, and it is predicted that the test observation belongs to the most commonly-occurring class, in this case blue. Right: The KNN decision boundary for this example is shown in black. The blue grid indicates the region in which a test observation will be assigned to the blue class, and the orange grid indicates the region in which it will be assigned to the orange class.
The choice of K has a drastic effect on the KNN classifier obtained. Figure 2.16 displays two KNN fits to the simulated data from Figure 2.13, using K = 1 and K = 100. When K = 1, the decision boundary is overly flexible and finds patterns in the data that don’t correspond to the Bayes decision boundary. This corresponds to a classifier that has low bias but very high variance. As K grows, the method becomes less flexible and produces a decision boundary that is close to linear. This corresponds to a low-variance but high-bias classifier. On this simulated data set, neither K = 1 nor K = 100 give good predictions: they have test error rates of 0.1695 and 0.1925, respectively. Just as in the regression setting, there is not a strong relationship between the training error rate and the test error rate. With K = 1, the KNN training error rate is 0, but the test error rate may be quite high. In general, as we use more flexible classification methods, the training error rate will decline but the test error rate may not. In Figure 2.17, we have plotted the KNN test and training errors as a function of 1/K. As 1/K increases, the method becomes more flexible. As in the regression setting, the training error rate consistently declines as the flexibility increases. However, the test error exhibits a characteristic U-shape, declining at first (with a minimum at approximately K = 10) before increasing again when the method becomes excessively flexible and overfits.

The black dashed line indicates the Bayes error rate. The jumpiness of the curves is due to the small size of the training data set.
In both the regression and classification settings, choosing the correct level of flexibility is critical to the success of any statistical learning method. The bias-variance tradeoff, and the resulting U-shape in the test error, can make this a difficult task. In Chapter 5, we return to this topic and discuss various methods for estimating test error rates and thereby choosing the optimal level of flexibility for a given statistical learning method.
2.3 Lab: Introduction to R
In this lab, we will introduce some simple R commands. The best way to learn a new language is to try out the commands. R can be downloaded from
http://cran.r-project.org/
2.3.1 Basic Commands
R uses functions to perform operations. To run a function called funcname, function
we type funcname(input1, input2), where the inputs (or arguments) input1 argument


2.3 Lab: Introduction to R 43
and input2 tell R how to run the function. A function can have any number of inputs. For example, to create a vector of numbers, we use the function c() (for concatenate). Any numbers inside the parentheses are joined to- c()
gether. The following command instructs R to join together the numbers 1, 3, 2, and 5, and to save them as a vector named x. When we type x, it vector
gives us back the vector.
> x <- c(1,3,2,5) >x [1] 1 3 2 5
Note that the > is not part of the command; rather, it is printed by R to indicate that it is ready for another command to be entered. We can also save things using = rather than <-:
> x = c(1,6,2) >x [1] 1 6 2 > y = c(1,4,3)
Hitting the up arrow multiple times will display the previous commands, which can then be edited. This is useful since one often wishes to repeat a similar command. In addition, typing ?funcname will always cause R to open a new help file window with additional information about the function funcname.
We can tell R to add two sets of numbers together. It will then add the first number from x to the first number from y, and so on. However, x and y should be the same length. We can check their length using the length() length()
function.
> length(x) [1] 3 > length(y) [1] 3 > x+y [1] 2 10 5
The ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects, such ls()
as data and functions, that we have saved so far. The rm() function can be rm()
used to delete any that we don’t want.
> ls() [1] "x" "y" > rm(x,y) > ls() character (0)
It’s also possible to remove all objects at once:
> rm(list=ls())


44 2. Statistical Learning
The matrix() function can be used to create a matrix of numbers. Before matrix()
we use the matrix() function, we can learn more about it:
> ?matrix
The help file reveals that the matrix() function takes a number of inputs, but for now we focus on the first three: the data (the entries in the matrix), the number of rows, and the number of columns. First, we create a simple matrix.
> x=matrix (data=c(1,2,3,4) , nrow=2, ncol =2) >x [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 3 [2,] 2 4
Note that we could just as well omit typing data=, nrow=, and ncol= in the matrix() command above: that is, we could just type
> x=matrix (c(1,2,3,4) ,2,2)
and this would have the same effect. However, it can sometimes be useful to specify the names of the arguments passed in, since otherwise R will assume that the function arguments are passed into the function in the same order that is given in the function’s help file. As this example illustrates, by default R creates matrices by successively filling in columns. Alternatively, the byrow=TRUE option can be used to populate the matrix in order of the rows.
> matrix (c(1,2,3,4) ,2,2,byrow =TRUE) [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 2 [2,] 3 4
Notice that in the above command we did not assign the matrix to a value such as x. In this case the matrix is printed to the screen but is not saved for future calculations. The sqrt() function returns the square root of each sqrt()
element of a vector or matrix. The command x^2 raises each element of x to the power 2; any powers are possible, including fractional or negative powers.
> sqrt(x) [,1] [,2] [1,] 1.00 1.73 [2,] 1.41 2.00 > x^2 [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 9 [2,] 4 16
The rnorm() function generates a vector of random normal variables, rnorm()
with first argument n the sample size. Each time we call this function, we will get a different answer. Here we create two correlated sets of numbers, x and y, and use the cor() function to compute the correlation between cor()
them.


2.3 Lab: Introduction to R 45
> x=rnorm(50) > y=x+rnorm (50,mean=50,sd=.1) > cor(x,y) [1] 0.995
By default, rnorm() creates standard normal random variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, the mean and standard deviation can be altered using the mean and sd arguments, as illustrated above. Sometimes we want our code to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers; we can use the set.seed() function to do this. The set.seed() set.seed()
function takes an (arbitrary) integer argument.
> set.seed (1303) > rnorm(50) [1] -1.1440 1.3421 2.1854 0.5364 0.0632 0.5022 -0.0004 ...
We use set.seed() throughout the labs whenever we perform calculations involving random quantities. In general this should allow the user to reproduce our results. However, it should be noted that as new versions of R become available it is possible that some small discrepancies may form between the book and the output from R. The mean() and var() functions can be used to compute the mean and mean()
var()
variance of a vector of numbers. Applying sqrt() to the output of var() will give the standard deviation. Or we can simply use the sd() function. sd()
> set.seed(3) > y=rnorm(100) > mean(y) [1] 0.0110 > var(y) [1] 0.7329 > sqrt(var(y)) [1] 0.8561 > sd(y) [1] 0.8561
2.3.2 Graphics
The plot() function is the primary way to plot data in R. For instance, plot()
plot(x,y) produces a scatterplot of the numbers in x versus the numbers in y. There are many additional options that can be passed in to the plot() function. For example, passing in the argument xlab will result in a label on the x-axis. To find out more information about the plot() function, type ?plot.
> x=rnorm(100) > y=rnorm(100) > plot(x,y) > plot(x,y,xlab="this is the x-axis",ylab="this is the y-axis", main="Plot of X vs Y")


46 2. Statistical Learning
We will often want to save the output of an R plot. The command that we use to do this will depend on the file type that we would like to create. For instance, to create a pdf, we use the pdf() function, and to create a jpeg, pdf()
we use the jpeg() function. jpeg()
> pdf ("Figure.pdf ") > plot(x,y,col ="green") > dev.off() null device 1
The function dev.off() indicates to R that we are done creating the plot. dev.off()
Alternatively, we can simply copy the plot window and paste it into an appropriate file type, such as a Word document. The function seq() can be used to create a sequence of numbers. For seq()
instance, seq(a,b) makes a vector of integers between a and b. There are many other options: for instance, seq(0,1,length=10) makes a sequence of 10 numbers that are equally spaced between 0 and 1. Typing 3:11 is a shorthand for seq(3,11) for integer arguments.
> x=seq (1,10) >x [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 > x=1:10 >x [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 > x=seq(-pi ,pi ,length =50)
We will now create some more sophisticated plots. The contour() func- contour()
tion produces a contour plot in order to represent three-dimensional data; contour plot
it is like a topographical map. It takes three arguments:
1. A vector of the x values (the first dimension),
2. A vector of the y values (the second dimension), and
3. A matrix whose elements correspond to the z value (the third dimension) for each pair of (x,y) coordinates.
As with the plot() function, there are many other inputs that can be used to fine-tune the output of the contour() function. To learn more about these, take a look at the help file by typing ?contour.
> y=x > f=outer(x,y,function (x,y)cos(y)/(1+x^2)) > contour (x,y,f) > contour (x,y,f,nlevels =45,add=T) > fa=(f-t(f))/2 > contour (x,y,fa,nlevels =15)
The image() function works the same way as contour(), except that it image()
produces a color-coded plot whose colors depend on the z value. This is


2.3 Lab: Introduction to R 47
known as a heatmap, and is sometimes used to plot temperature in weather heatmap
forecasts. Alternatively, persp() can be used to produce a three-dimensional persp()
plot. The arguments theta and phi control the angles at which the plot is viewed.
> image(x,y,fa) > persp(x,y,fa) > persp(x,y,fa ,theta =30) > persp(x,y,fa ,theta =30, phi =20) > persp(x,y,fa ,theta =30, phi =70) > persp(x,y,fa ,theta =30, phi =40)
2.3.3 Indexing Data
We often wish to examine part of a set of data. Suppose that our data is stored in the matrix A.
> A=matrix (1:16,4,4) >A [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 1 5 9 13 [2,] 2 6 10 14 [3,] 3 7 11 15 [4,] 4 8 12 16
Then, typing
> A[2,3] [1] 10
will select the element corresponding to the second row and the third column. The first number after the open-bracket symbol [ always refers to the row, and the second number always refers to the column. We can also select multiple rows and columns at a time, by providing vectors as the indices.
> A[c(1,3),c(2,4)] [,1] [,2] [1,] 5 13 [2,] 7 15 > A[1:3,2:4] [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 5 9 13 [2,] 6 10 14 [3,] 7 11 15 > A[1:2,] [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 1 5 9 13 [2,] 2 6 10 14 > A[,1:2] [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 5 [2,] 2 6


48 2. Statistical Learning
[3,] 3 7 [4,] 4 8
The last two examples include either no index for the columns or no index for the rows. These indicate that R should include all columns or all rows, respectively. R treats a single row or column of a matrix as a vector.
> A[1,] [1] 1 5 9 13
The use of a negative sign - in the index tells R to keep all rows or columns except those indicated in the index.
> A[-c(1,3) ,] [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 2 6 10 14 [2,] 4 8 12 16 > A[-c(1,3) ,-c(1,3,4)] [1] 6 8
The dim() function outputs the number of rows followed by the number of dim()
columns of a given matrix.
> dim(A) [1] 4 4
2.3.4 Loading Data
For most analyses, the first step involves importing a data set into R. The read.table() function is one of the primary ways to do this. The help file read.table()
contains details about how to use this function. We can use the function
write.table() to export data. write.
table()
Before attempting to load a data set, we must make sure that R knows to search for the data in the proper directory. For example on a Windows system one could select the directory using the Change dir. . . option under the File menu. However, the details of how to do this depend on the operating system (e.g. Windows, Mac, Unix) that is being used, and so we do not give further details here. We begin by loading in the Auto data set. This data is part of the ISLR library (we discuss libraries in Chapter 3) but to illustrate the read.table() function we load it now from a text file. The following command will load the Auto.data file into R and store it as an object called Auto, in a format referred to as a data frame. (The text file data frame
can be obtained from this book’s website.) Once the data has been loaded, the fix() function can be used to view it in a spreadsheet like window. However, the window must be closed before further R commands can be entered.
> Auto=read.table ("Auto.data") > fix(Auto)


2.3 Lab: Introduction to R 49
Note that Auto.data is simply a text file, which you could alternatively open on your computer using a standard text editor. It is often a good idea to view a data set using a text editor or other software such as Excel before loading it into R. This particular data set has not been loaded correctly, because R has assumed that the variable names are part of the data and so has included them in the first row. The data set also includes a number of missing observations, indicated by a question mark ?. Missing values are a common occurrence in real data sets. Using the option header=T (or header=TRUE) in the read.table() function tells R that the first line of the file contains the variable names, and using the option na.strings tells R that any time it sees a particular character or set of characters (such as a question mark), it should be treated as a missing element of the data matrix.
> Auto=read.table ("Auto.data",header=T,na.strings ="?") > fix(Auto)
Excel is a common-format data storage program. An easy way to load such data into R is to save it as a csv (comma separated value) file and then use the read.csv() function to load it in.
> Auto=read.csv("Auto.csv",header=T,na.strings ="?") > fix(Auto) > dim(Auto) [1] 397 9 > Auto[1:4,]
The dim() function tells us that the data has 397 observations, or rows, and dim()
nine variables, or columns. There are various ways to deal with the missing data. In this case, only five of the rows contain missing observations, and so we choose to use the na.omit() function to simply remove these rows. na.omit()
> Auto=na.omit(Auto) > dim(Auto) [1] 392 9
Once the data are loaded correctly, we can use names() to check the names()
variable names.
> names(Auto) [1] "mpg" "cylinders " "displacement" "horsepower " [5] "weight " "acceleration" "year" "origin " [9] "name"
2.3.5 Additional Graphical and Numerical Summaries
We can use the plot() function to produce scatterplots of the quantitative scatterplot
variables. However, simply typing the variable names will produce an error message, because R does not know to look in the Auto data set for those variables.


50 2. Statistical Learning
> plot(cylinders , mpg) Error in plot(cylinders , mpg) : object ’cylinders ’ not found
To refer to a variable, we must type the data set and the variable name joined with a $ symbol. Alternatively, we can use the attach() function in attach()
order to tell R to make the variables in this data frame available by name.
> plot(Auto$cylinders , Auto$mpg ) > attach(Auto) > plot(cylinders , mpg)
The cylinders variable is stored as a numeric vector, so R has treated it as quantitative. However, since there are only a small number of possible values for cylinders, one may prefer to treat it as a qualitative variable. The as.factor() function converts quantitative variables into qualitative as.factor()
variables.
> cylinders =as.factor (cylinders )
If the variable plotted on the x-axis is categorial, then boxplots will boxplot
automatically be produced by the plot() function. As usual, a number of options can be specified in order to customize the plots.
> plot(cylinders , mpg) > plot(cylinders , mpg , col ="red ") > plot(cylinders , mpg , col ="red", varwidth =T) > plot(cylinders , mpg , col ="red", varwidth =T,horizontal =T) > plot(cylinders , mpg , col ="red", varwidth =T, xlab=" cylinders ", ylab =" MPG ")
The hist() function can be used to plot a histogram. Note that col=2 hist()
histogram
has the same effect as col="red".
> hist(mpg) > hist(mpg ,col =2) > hist(mpg ,col =2, breaks =15)
The pairs() function creates a scatterplot matrix i.e. a scatterplot for every scatterplot
matrix
pair of variables for any given data set. We can also produce scatterplots for just a subset of the variables.
> pairs(Auto) > pairs (∼ mpg + d i s p l a c e m e n t + horsepowe r + weight + acceleration , Auto)
In conjunction with the plot() function, identify() provides a useful identify()
interactive method for identifying the value for a particular variable for points on a plot. We pass in three arguments to identify(): the x-axis variable, the y-axis variable, and the variable whose values we would like to see printed for each point. Then clicking on a given point in the plot will cause R to print the value of the variable of interest. Right-clicking on the plot will exit the identify() function (control-click on a Mac). The numbers printed under the identify() function correspond to the rows for the selected points.


2.3 Lab: Introduction to R 51
> plot(horsepower ,mpg) > identify (horsepower ,mpg ,name)
The summary() function produces a numerical summary of each variable in summary()
a particular data set.
> summary (Auto) mpg cylinders displacement Min. : 9.00 Min. :3.000 Min. : 68.0 1st Qu.:17.00 1st Qu.:4.000 1st Qu.:105.0 Median :22.75 Median :4.000 Median :151.0 Mean :23.45 Mean :5.472 Mean :194.4 3rd Qu.:29.00 3rd Qu.:8.000 3rd Qu.:275.8 Max. :46.60 Max. :8.000 Max. :455.0

For qualitative variables such as name, R will list the number of observations that fall in each category. We can also produce a summary of just a single variable.
> summary (mpg) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 9.00 17.00 22.75 23.45 29.00 46.60
Once we have finished using R, we type q() in order to shut it down, or q()
quit. When exiting R, we have the option to save the current workspace so workspace
that all objects (such as data sets) that we have created in this R session will be available next time. Before exiting R, we may want to save a record of all of the commands that we typed in the most recent session; this can be accomplished using the savehistory() function. Next time we enter R, savehistory()
we can load that history using the loadhistory() function. loadhistory()

Applied
8. This exercise relates to the College data set, which can be found in the file College.csv. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are
• Private : Public/private indicator
• Apps : Number of applications received
• Accept : Number of applicants accepted
• Enroll : Number of new students enrolled
• Top10perc : New students from top 10 % of high school class
• Top25perc : New students from top 25 % of high school class
• F.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates
• P.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates
• Outstate : Out-of-state tuition
• Room.Board : Room and board costs
• Books : Estimated book costs
• Personal : Estimated personal spending
• PhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.’s
• Terminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree
• S.F.Ratio : Student/faculty ratio
• perc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate
• Expend : Instructional expenditure per student
• Grad.Rate : Graduation rate
Before reading the data into R, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor.
(a) Use the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.
(b) Look at the data using the fix() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don’t really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:


2.4 Exercises 55
> rownames (college )=college [,1] > fix(college )
You should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However, we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try
> college =college [,-1] > fix(college )
Now you should see that the first data column is Private. Note that another column labeled row.names now appears before the Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.
(c) i. Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.
ii. Use the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[,1:10].
iii. Use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private.
iv. Create a new qualitative variable, called Elite, by binning the Top10perc variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10 % of their high school classes exceeds 50 %.
> Elite=rep("No",nrow(college )) > Elite[college$Top10perc >50]=" Yes" > Elite=as.factor(Elite) > college =data.frame(college ,Elite)
Use the summary() function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite.
v. Use the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. You may find the command par(mfrow=c(2,2)) useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways.
vi. Continue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.

Linear Regression
This chapter is about linear regression, a very simple approach for supervised learning. In particular, linear regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response. Linear regression has been around for a long time and is the topic of innumerable textbooks. Though it may seem somewhat dull compared to some of the more modern statistical learning approaches described in later chapters of this book, linear regression is still a useful and widely used statistical learning method. Moreover, it serves as a good jumping-off point for newer approaches: as we will see in later chapters, many fancy statistical learning approaches can be seen as generalizations or extensions of linear regression. Consequently, the importance of having a good understanding of linear regression before studying more complex learning methods cannot be overstated. In this chapter, we review some of the key ideas underlying the linear regression model, as well as the least squares approach that is most commonly used to fit this model. Recall the Advertising data from Chapter 2. Figure 2.1 displays sales (in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media. Suppose that in our role as statistical consultants we are asked to suggest, on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will result in high product sales. What information would be useful in order to provide such a recommendation? Here are a few important questions that we might seek to address:
1. Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?
Our first goal should be to determine whether the data provide

60 3. Linear Regression
evidence of an association between advertising expenditure and sales. If the evidence is weak, then one might argue that no money should be spent on advertising!
2. How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales? Assuming that there is a relationship between advertising and sales, we would like to know the strength of this relationship. In other words, given a certain advertising budget, can we predict sales with a high level of accuracy? This would be a strong relationship. Or is a prediction of sales based on advertising expenditure only slightly better than a random guess? This would be a weak relationship.
3. Which media contribute to sales?
Do all three media—TV, radio, and newspaper—contribute to sales, or do just one or two of the media contribute? To answer this question, we must find a way to separate out the individual effects of each medium when we have spent money on all three media.
4. How accurately can we estimate the effect of each medium on sales? For every dollar spent on advertising in a particular medium, by what amount will sales increase? How accurately can we predict this amount of increase?
5. How accurately can we predict future sales?
For any given level of television, radio, or newspaper advertising, what is our prediction for sales, and what is the accuracy of this prediction?
6. Is the relationship linear?
If there is approximately a straight-line relationship between advertising expenditure in the various media and sales, then linear regression is an appropriate tool. If not, then it may still be possible to transform the predictor or the response so that linear regression can be used.
7. Is there synergy among the advertising media?
Perhaps spending $50,000 on television advertising and $50,000 on radio advertising results in more sales than allocating $100,000 to either television or radio individually. In marketing, this is known as a synergy effect, while in statistics it is called an interaction effect. synergy
interaction
It turns out that linear regression can be used to answer each of these questions. We will first discuss all of these questions in a general context, and then return to them in this specific context in Section 3.4.


3.1 Simple Linear Regression 61
3.1 Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression lives up to its name: it is a very straightforward simple linear
regression
approach for predicting a quantitative response Y on the basis of a single predictor variable X. It assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between X and Y . Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as
Y ≈ β0 + β1X. (3.1)
You might read “≈” as “is approximately modeled as”. We will sometimes describe (3.1) by saying that we are regressing Y on X (or Y onto X). For example, X may represent TV advertising and Y may represent sales. Then we can regress sales onto TV by fitting the model
sales ≈ β0 + β1 × TV.
In Equation 3.1, β0 and β1 are two unknown constants that represent the intercept and slope terms in the linear model. Together, β0 and β1 are intercept
slope
known as the model coefficients or parameters. Once we have used our
coefficient parameter
training data to produce estimates βˆ0 and βˆ1 for the model coefficients, we can predict future sales on the basis of a particular value of TV advertising by computing yˆ = βˆ0 + βˆ1x, (3.2)
where yˆ indicates a prediction of Y on the basis of X = x. Here we use a hat symbol, ˆ , to denote the estimated value for an unknown parameter or coefficient, or to denote the predicted value of the response.
3.1.1 Estimating the Coefficients
In practice, β0 and β1 are unknown. So before we can use (3.1) to make predictions, we must use data to estimate the coefficients. Let
(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn)
represent n observation pairs, each of which consists of a measurement of X and a measurement of Y . In the Advertising example, this data set consists of the TV advertising budget and product sales in n = 200 different markets. (Recall that the data are displayed in Figure 2.1.) Our goal is to obtain coefficient estimates βˆ0 and βˆ1 such that the linear model
(3.1) fits the available data well—that is, so that yi ≈ βˆ0 + βˆ1xi for i = 1, . . . , n. In other words, we want to find an intercept βˆ0 and a slope βˆ1 such that the resulting line is as close as possible to the n = 200 data points. There are a number of ways of measuring closeness. However, by far the most common approach involves minimizing the least squares criterion, least squares
and we take that approach in this chapter. Alternative approaches will be considered in Chapter 6.

FIGURE 3.1. For the Advertising data, the least squares fit for the regression of sales onto TV is shown. The fit is found by minimizing the sum of squared errors. Each grey line segment represents an error, and the fit makes a compromise by averaging their squares. In this case a linear fit captures the essence of the relationship, although it is somewhat deficient in the left of the plot.
Let yˆi = βˆ0 + βˆ1xi be the prediction for Y based on the ith value of X. Then ei = yi − yˆi represents the ith residual—this is the difference between residual
the ith observed response value and the ith response value that is predicted by our linear model. We define the residual sum of squares (RSS) as residual sum

or equivalently as
RSS = (y1 − βˆ0 − βˆ1x1)2 + (y2 − βˆ0 − βˆ1x2)2 + . . . + (yn − βˆ0 − βˆ1xn)2. (3.3)
The least squares approach chooses βˆ0 and βˆ1 to minimize the RSS. Using some calculus, one can show that the minimizers are

this approximation, an additional $1,000 spent on TV advertising is associated with selling approximately 47.5 additional units of the product. In Figure 3.2, we have computed RSS for a number of values of β0 and β1, using the advertising data with sales as the response and TV as the predictor. In each plot, the red dot represents the pair of least squares estimates (βˆ0, βˆ1) given by (3.4). These values clearly minimize the RSS.
3.1.2 Assessing the Accuracy of the Coefficient Estimates
Recall from (2.1) that we assume that the true relationship between X and Y takes the form Y = f (X) + for some unknown function f , where is a mean-zero random error term. If f is to be approximated by a linear function, then we can write this relationship as
Y = β0 + β1X + . (3.5)
Here β0 is the intercept term—that is, the expected value of Y when X = 0, and β1 is the slope—the average increase in Y associated with a one-unit increase in X. The error term is a catch-all for what we miss with this simple model: the true relationship is probably not linear, there may be other variables that cause variation in Y , and there may be measurement error. We typically assume that the error term is independent of X. The model given by (3.5) defines the population regression line, which population
regression line
is the best linear approximation to the true relationship between X and Y .1 The least squares regression coefficient estimates (3.4) characterize the least squares line (3.2). The left-hand panel of Figure 3.3 displays these least squares
line
1The assumption of linearity is often a useful working model. However, despite what many textbooks might tell us, we seldom believe that the true relationship is linear.

FIGURE 3.3. A simulated data set. Left: The red line represents the true relationship, f (X) = 2 + 3X, which is known as the population regression line. The blue line is the least squares line; it is the least squares estimate for f (X) based on the observed data, shown in black. Right: The population regression line is again shown in red, and the least squares line in dark blue. In light blue, ten least squares lines are shown, each computed on the basis of a separate random set of observations.

two lines in a simple simulated example. We created 100 random Xs, and generated 100 corresponding Y s from the model
Y = 2 + 3X + , (3.6)
where was generated from a normal distribution with mean zero. The red line in the left-hand panel of Figure 3.3 displays the true relationship, f (X) = 2 + 3X, while the blue line is the least squares estimate based on the observed data. The true relationship is generally not known for real data, but the least squares line can always be computed using the coefficient estimates given in (3.4). In other words, in real applications, we have access to a set of observations from which we can compute the least squares line; however, the population regression line is unobserved. In the right-hand panel of Figure 3.3 we have generated ten different data sets from the model given by (3.6) and plotted the corresponding ten least squares lines. Notice that different data sets generated from the same true model result in slightly different least squares lines, but the unobserved population regression line does not change. At first glance, the difference between the population regression line and the least squares line may seem subtle and confusing. We only have one data set, and so what does it mean that two different lines describe the relationship between the predictor and the response? Fundamentally, the


3.1 Simple Linear Regression 65
concept of these two lines is a natural extension of the standard statistical approach of using information from a sample to estimate characteristics of a large population. For example, suppose that we are interested in knowing the population mean μ of some random variable Y . Unfortunately, μ is unknown, but we do have access to n observations from Y , which we can write as y1, . . . , yn, and which we can use to estimate μ. A reasonable estimate is μˆ = y ̄, where y ̄ = 1
n
∑n
i=1 yi is the sample mean. The sample mean and the population mean are different, but in general the sample mean will provide a good estimate of the population mean. In the same way, the unknown coefficients β0 and β1 in linear regression define the population regression line. We seek to estimate these unknown coefficients using βˆ0 and βˆ1 given in (3.4). These coefficient estimates define the least squares line. The analogy between linear regression and estimation of the mean of a random variable is an apt one based on the concept of bias. If we use the bias
sample mean μˆ to estimate μ, this estimate is unbiased, in the sense that unbiased
on average, we expect μˆ to equal μ. What exactly does this mean? It means that on the basis of one particular set of observations y1, . . . , yn, μˆ might overestimate μ, and on the basis of another set of observations, μˆ might underestimate μ. But if we could average a huge number of estimates of μ obtained from a huge number of sets of observations, then this average would exactly equal μ. Hence, an unbiased estimator does not systematically over- or under-estimate the true parameter. The property of unbiasedness holds for the least squares coefficient estimates given by (3.4) as well: if we estimate β0 and β1 on the basis of a particular data set, then our estimates won’t be exactly equal to β0 and β1. But if we could average the estimates obtained over a huge number of data sets, then the average of these estimates would be spot on! In fact, we can see from the righthand panel of Figure 3.3 that the average of many least squares lines, each estimated from a separate data set, is pretty close to the true population regression line. We continue the analogy with the estimation of the population mean μ of a random variable Y . A natural question is as follows: how accurate is the sample mean μˆ as an estimate of μ? We have established that the average of μˆ’s over many data sets will be very close to μ, but that a single estimate μˆ may be a substantial underestimate or overestimate of μ. How far off will that single estimate of μˆ be? In general, we answer this question by computing the standard error of μˆ, written as SE(μˆ). We have standard
error
the well-known formula
Var(μˆ) = SE(μˆ)2 = σ2
n , (3.7)


66 3. Linear Regression
where σ is the standard deviation of each of the realizations yi of Y .2 Roughly speaking, the standard error tells us the average amount that this estimate μˆ differs from the actual value of μ. Equation 3.7 also tells us how this deviation shrinks with n—the more observations we have, the smaller the standard error of μˆ. In a similar vein, we can wonder how close βˆ0
and βˆ1 are to the true values β0 and β1. To compute the standard errors
associated with βˆ0 and βˆ1, we use the following formulas:
SE(βˆ0)2 = σ2

∑n
i=1(xi − x ̄)2
]
, SE(βˆ1)2 = σ2
∑n
i=1(xi − x ̄)2 , (3.8)
where σ2 = Var( ). For these formulas to be strictly valid, we need to assume that the errors i for each observation are uncorrelated with common variance σ2. This is clearly not true in Figure 3.1, but the formula still turns out to be a good approximation. Notice in the formula that SE(βˆ1) is smaller when the xi are more spread out; intuitively we have more leverage
to estimate a slope when this is the case. We also see that SE(βˆ0) would be the same as SE(μˆ) if x ̄ were zero (in which case βˆ0 would be equal to y ̄). In general, σ2 is not known, but can be estimated from the data. The estimate of σ is known as the residual standard error, and is given by the formula residual
standard error
RSE = √RSS/(n − 2). Strictly speaking, when σ2 is estimated from the
data we should write ̂SE(βˆ1) to indicate that an estimate has been made, but for simplicity of notation we will drop this extra “hat”. Standard errors can be used to compute confidence intervals. A 95 % confidence
interval
confidence interval is defined as a range of values such that with 95 % probability, the range will contain the true unknown value of the parameter. The range is defined in terms of lower and upper limits computed from the sample of data. For linear regression, the 95 % confidence interval for β1 approximately takes the form
βˆ1 ± 2 · SE(βˆ1). (3.9)
That is, there is approximately a 95 % chance that the interval
[βˆ1 − 2 · SE(βˆ1), βˆ1 + 2 · SE(βˆ1)
]
(3.10)
will contain the true value of β1.3 Similarly, a confidence interval for β0 approximately takes the form
βˆ0 ± 2 · SE(βˆ0). (3.11)
2This formula holds provided that the n observations are uncorrelated. 3Approximately for several reasons. Equation 3.10 relies on the assumption that the errors are Gaussian. Also, the factor of 2 in front of the SE(βˆ1) term will vary slightly depending on the number of observations n in the linear regression. To be precise, rather than the number 2, (3.10) should contain the 97.5 % quantile of a t-distribution with n−2 degrees of freedom. Details of how to compute the 95 % confidence interval precisely in R will be provided later in this chapter.


3.1 Simple Linear Regression 67
In the case of the advertising data, the 95 % confidence interval for β0 is [6.130, 7.935] and the 95 % confidence interval for β1 is [0.042, 0.053]. Therefore, we can conclude that in the absence of any advertising, sales will, on average, fall somewhere between 6,130 and 7,940 units. Furthermore, for each $1,000 increase in television advertising, there will be an average increase in sales of between 42 and 53 units. Standard errors can also be used to perform hypothesis tests on the hypothesis

coefficients. The most common hypothesis test involves testing the null

H0 : There is no relationship between X and Y (3.12)
versus the alternative hypothesis alternative
hypothesis
Ha : There is some relationship between X and Y . (3.13)
Mathematically, this corresponds to testing
H0 : β1 = 0
versus Ha : β1 = 0,
since if β1 = 0 then the model (3.5) reduces to Y = β0 + , and X is not associated with Y . To test the null hypothesis, we need to determine whether βˆ1, our estimate for β1, is sufficiently far from zero that we can be confident that β1 is non-zero. How far is far enough? This of course
depends on the accuracy of βˆ1—that is, it depends on SE(βˆ1). If SE(βˆ1) is small, then even relatively small values of βˆ1 may provide strong evidence that β1 = 0, and hence that there is a relationship between X and Y . In
contrast, if SE(βˆ1) is large, then βˆ1 must be large in absolute value in order for us to reject the null hypothesis. In practice, we compute a t-statistic, t-statistic
given by
t=
βˆ1 − 0
SE(βˆ1) , (3.14)
which measures the number of standard deviations that βˆ1 is away from 0. If there really is no relationship between X and Y , then we expect that (3.14) will have a t-distribution with n − 2 degrees of freedom. The tdistribution has a bell shape and for values of n greater than approximately 30 it is quite similar to the normal distribution. Consequently, it is a simple matter to compute the probability of observing any number equal to |t| or larger in absolute value, assuming β1 = 0. We call this probability the p-value. p-value

68 3. Linear Regression
then we can infer that there is an association between the predictor and the response. We reject the null hypothesis—that is, we declare a relationship to exist between X and Y —if the p-value is small enough. Typical p-value cutoffs for rejecting the null hypothesis are 5 or 1 %. When n = 30, these correspond to t-statistics (3.14) of around 2 and 2.75, respectively.

An increase of $1,000 in the TV advertising budget is associated with an increase in sales by around 50 units (Recall that the sales variable is in thousands of units, and the TV variable is in thousands of dollars).
Table 3.1 provides details of the least squares model for the regression of number of units sold on TV advertising budget for the Advertising data. Notice that the coefficients for βˆ0 and βˆ1 are very large relative to their standard errors, so the t-statistics are also large; the probabilities of seeing such values if H0 is true are virtually zero. Hence we can conclude that β0 = 0 and β1 = 0.4
3.1.3 Assessing the Accuracy of the Model
Once we have rejected the null hypothesis (3.12) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (3.13), it is natural to want to quantify the extent to which the model fits the data. The quality of a linear regression fit is typically assessed
using two related quantities: the residual standard error (RSE) and the R2
R2
statistic. Table 3.2 displays the RSE, the R2 statistic, and the F-statistic (to be described in Section 3.2.2) for the linear regression of number of units sold on TV advertising budget.
Residual Standard Error
Recall from the model (3.5) that associated with each observation is an error term . Due to the presence of these error terms, even if we knew the true regression line (i.e. even if β0 and β1 were known), we would not be able to perfectly predict Y from X. The RSE is an estimate of the standard
4In Table 3.1, a small p-value for the intercept indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis that β0 = 0, and a small p-value for TV indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis that β1 = 0. Rejecting the latter null hypothesis allows us to conclude that there is a relationship between TV and sales. Rejecting the former allows us to conclude that in the absence of TV expenditure, sales are non-zero.

Note that RSS was defined in Section 3.1.1, and is given by the formula
RSS =

i=1
(yi − yˆi)2. (3.16)
In the case of the advertising data, we see from the linear regression output in Table 3.2 that the RSE is 3.26. In other words, actual sales in each market deviate from the true regression line by approximately 3,260 units, on average. Another way to think about this is that even if the model were correct and the true values of the unknown coefficients β0 and β1 were known exactly, any prediction of sales on the basis of TV advertising would still be off by about 3,260 units on average. Of course, whether or not 3,260 units is an acceptable prediction error depends on the problem context. In the advertising data set, the mean value of sales over all markets is approximately 14,000 units, and so the percentage error is 3,260/14,000 = 23 %. The RSE is considered a measure of the lack of fit of the model (3.5) to the data. If the predictions obtained using the model are very close to the true outcome values—that is, if yˆi ≈ yi for i = 1, . . . , n—then (3.15) will be small, and we can conclude that the model fits the data very well. On the other hand, if yˆi is very far from yi for one or more observations, then the RSE may be quite large, indicating that the model doesn’t fit the data well.
R2 Statistic
The RSE provides an absolute measure of lack of fit of the model (3.5) to the data. But since it is measured in the units of Y , it is not always clear what constitutes a good RSE. The R2 statistic provides an alternative measure of fit. It takes the form of a proportion—the proportion of variance explained—and so it always takes on a value between 0 and 1, and is independent of the scale of Y .


70 3. Linear Regression
To calculate R2, we use the formula
R2 = TSS − RSS
TSS = 1 − RSS
TSS (3.17)
where TSS = ∑(yi − y ̄)2 is the total sum of squares, and RSS is defined total sum of
squares
in (3.16). TSS measures the total variance in the response Y , and can be thought of as the amount of variability inherent in the response before the regression is performed. In contrast, RSS measures the amount of variability that is left unexplained after performing the regression. Hence, TSS − RSS measures the amount of variability in the response that is explained (or removed) by performing the regression, and R2 measures the proportion of variability in Y that can be explained using X. An R2 statistic that is close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the response has been explained by the regression. A number near 0 indicates that the regression did not explain much of the variability in the response; this might occur because the linear model is wrong, or the inherent error σ2 is high, or both. In Table 3.2, the R2 was 0.61, and so just under two-thirds of the variability in sales is explained by a linear regression on TV. The R2 statistic (3.17) has an interpretational advantage over the RSE (3.15), since unlike the RSE, it always lies between 0 and 1. However, it can still be challenging to determine what is a good R2 value, and in general, this will depend on the application. For instance, in certain problems in physics, we may know that the data truly comes from a linear model with a small residual error. In this case, we would expect to see an R2 value that is extremely close to 1, and a substantially smaller R2 value might indicate a serious problem with the experiment in which the data were generated. On the other hand, in typical applications in biology, psychology, marketing, and other domains, the linear model (3.5) is at best an extremely rough approximation to the data, and residual errors due to other unmeasured factors are often very large. In this setting, we would expect only a very small proportion of the variance in the response to be explained by the predictor, and an R2 value well below 0.1 might be more realistic! The R2 statistic is a measure of the linear relationship between X and Y . Recall that correlation, defined as correlation
Cor(X, Y ) =
∑n
i=1(xi − x)(yi − y)
√∑n
i=1(xi − x)2√∑n
i=1(yi − y)2 , (3.18)
is also a measure of the linear relationship between X and Y .5 This suggests that we might be able to use r = Cor(X, Y ) instead of R2 in order to assess the fit of the linear model. In fact, it can be shown that in the simple linear regression setting, R2 = r2. In other words, the squared correlation
5We note that in fact, the right-hand side of (3.18) is the sample correlation; thus, it would be more correct to write Côr(X, Y ); however, we omit the “hat” for ease of notation.


3.2 Multiple Linear Regression 71
and the R2 statistic are identical. However, in the next section we will discuss the multiple linear regression problem, in which we use several predictors simultaneously to predict the response. The concept of correlation between the predictors and the response does not extend automatically to this setting, since correlation quantifies the association between a single pair of variables rather than between a larger number of variables. We will see that R2 fills this role.
3.2 Multiple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a useful approach for predicting a response on the basis of a single predictor variable. However, in practice we often have more than one predictor. For example, in the Advertising data, we have examined the relationship between sales and TV advertising. We also have data for the amount of money spent advertising on the radio and in newspapers, and we may want to know whether either of these two media is associated with sales. How can we extend our analysis of the advertising data in order to accommodate these two additional predictors? One option is to run three separate simple linear regressions, each of which uses a different advertising medium as a predictor. For instance, we can fit a simple linear regression to predict sales on the basis of the amount spent on radio advertisements. Results are shown in Table 3.3 (top table). We find that a $1,000 increase in spending on radio advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 203 units. Table 3.3 (bottom table) contains the least squares coefficients for a simple linear regression of sales onto newspaper advertising budget. A $1,000 increase in newspaper advertising budget is associated with an increase in sales by approximately 55 units. However, the approach of fitting a separate simple linear regression model for each predictor is not entirely satisfactory. First of all, it is unclear how to make a single prediction of sales given levels of the three advertising media budgets, since each of the budgets is associated with a separate regression equation. Second, each of the three regression equations ignores the other two media in forming estimates for the regression coefficients. We will see shortly that if the media budgets are correlated with each other in the 200 markets that constitute our data set, then this can lead to very misleading estimates of the individual media effects on sales. Instead of fitting a separate simple linear regression model for each predictor, a better approach is to extend the simple linear regression model (3.5) so that it can directly accommodate multiple predictors. We can do this by giving each predictor a separate slope coefficient in a single model. In general, suppose that we have p distinct predictors. Then the multiple linear regression model takes the form
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + · · · + βpXp + , (3.19)

where Xj represents the jth predictor and βj quantifies the association between that variable and the response. We interpret βj as the average effect on Y of a one unit increase in Xj, holding all other predictors fixed. In the advertising example, (3.19) becomes
sales = β0 + β1 × TV + β2 × radio + β3 × newspaper + . (3.20)
3.2.1 Estimating the Regression Coefficients
As was the case in the simple linear regression setting, the regression coefficients β0, β1, . . . , βp in (3.19) are unknown, and must be estimated. Given estimates βˆ0, βˆ1, . . . , βˆp, we can make predictions using the formula
yˆ = βˆ0 + βˆ1x1 + βˆ2x2 + · · · + βˆpxp. (3.21)

FIGURE 3.4. In a three-dimensional setting, with two predictors and one response, the least squares regression line becomes a plane. The plane is chosen to minimize the sum of the squared vertical distances between each observation (shown in red) and the plane.
The values βˆ0, βˆ1, . . . , βˆp that minimize (3.22) are the multiple least squares regression coefficient estimates. Unlike the simple linear regression estimates given in (3.4), the multiple regression coefficient estimates have somewhat complicated forms that are most easily represented using matrix algebra. For this reason, we do not provide them here. Any statistical software package can be used to compute these coefficient estimates, and later in this chapter we will show how this can be done in R. Figure 3.4 illustrates an example of the least squares fit to a toy data set with p = 2 predictors. Table 3.4 displays the multiple regression coefficient estimates when TV, radio, and newspaper advertising budgets are used to predict product sales using the Advertising data. We interpret these results as follows: for a given amount of TV and newspaper advertising, spending an additional $1,000 on radio advertising leads to an increase in sales by approximately 189 units. Comparing these coefficient estimates to those displayed in Tables 3.1 and 3.3, we notice that the multiple regression coefficient estimates for TV and radio are pretty similar to the simple linear regression coefficient estimates. However, while the newspaper regression coefficient estimate in Table 3.3 was significantly non-zero, the coefficient estimate for newspaper in the multiple regression model is close to zero, and the corresponding p-value is no longer significant, with a value around 0.86.

that the simple and multiple regression coefficients can be quite different. This difference stems from the fact that in the simple regression case, the slope term represents the average effect of a $1,000 increase in newspaper advertising, ignoring other predictors such as TV and radio. In contrast, in the multiple regression setting, the coefficient for newspaper represents the average effect of increasing newspaper spending by $1,000 while holding TV and radio fixed. Does it make sense for the multiple regression to suggest no relationship between sales and newspaper while the simple linear regression implies the opposite? In fact it does. Consider the correlation matrix for the three predictor variables and response variable, displayed in Table 3.5. Notice that the correlation between radio and newspaper is 0.35. This reveals a tendency to spend more on newspaper advertising in markets where more is spent on radio advertising. Now suppose that the multiple regression is correct and newspaper advertising has no direct impact on sales, but radio advertising does increase sales. Then in markets where we spend more on radio our sales will tend to be higher, and as our correlation matrix shows, we also tend to spend more on newspaper advertising in those same markets. Hence, in a simple linear regression which only examines sales versus newspaper, we will observe that higher values of newspaper tend to be associated with higher values of sales, even though newspaper advertising does not actually affect sales. So newspaper sales are a surrogate for radio advertising; newspaper gets “credit” for the effect of radio on sales. This slightly counterintuitive result is very common in many real life situations. Consider an absurd example to illustrate the point. Running a regression of shark attacks versus ice cream sales for data collected at a given beach community over a period of time would show a positive relationship, similar to that seen between sales and newspaper. Of course no one (yet) has suggested that ice creams should be banned at beaches to reduce shark attacks. In reality, higher temperatures cause more people to visit the beach, which in turn results in more ice cream sales and more shark attacks. A multiple regression of attacks versus ice cream sales and temperature reveals that, as intuition implies, the former predictor is no longer significant after adjusting for temperature.

3.2.2 Some Important Questions
When we perform multiple linear regression, we usually are interested in answering a few important questions.
1. Is at least one of the predictors X1, X2, . . . , Xp useful in predicting the response?
2. Do all the predictors help to explain Y , or is only a subset of the predictors useful?
3. How well does the model fit the data?
4. Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict, and how accurate is our prediction?
We now address each of these questions in turn.
One: Is There a Relationship Between the Response and Predictors?
Recall that in the simple linear regression setting, in order to determine whether there is a relationship between the response and the predictor we can simply check whether β1 = 0. In the multiple regression setting with p predictors, we need to ask whether all of the regression coefficients are zero, i.e. whether β1 = β2 = · · · = βp = 0. As in the simple linear regression setting, we use a hypothesis test to answer this question. We test the null hypothesis,
H0 : β1 = β2 = · · · = βp = 0
versus the alternative
Ha : at least one βj is non-zero.
This hypothesis test is performed by computing the F-statistic, F-statistic
F = (TSS − RSS)/p
RSS/(n − p − 1) , (3.23)

where, as with simple linear regression, TSS = ∑(yi − y ̄)2 and RSS =
∑(yi − yˆi)2. If the linear model assumptions are correct, one can show that
E{RSS/(n − p − 1)} = σ2
and that, provided H0 is true,
E{(TSS − RSS)/p} = σ2.
Hence, when there is no relationship between the response and predictors, one would expect the F-statistic to take on a value close to 1. On the other hand, if Ha is true, then E{(TSS − RSS)/p} > σ2, so we expect F to be greater than 1. The F-statistic for the multiple linear regression model obtained by regressing sales onto radio, TV, and newspaper is shown in Table 3.6. In this example the F-statistic is 570. Since this is far larger than 1, it provides compelling evidence against the null hypothesis H0. In other words, the large F-statistic suggests that at least one of the advertising media must be related to sales. However, what if the F-statistic had been closer to 1? How large does the F-statistic need to be before we can reject H0 and conclude that there is a relationship? It turns out that the answer depends on the values of n and p. When n is large, an F-statistic that is just a little larger than 1 might still provide evidence against H0. In contrast, a larger F-statistic is needed to reject H0 if n is small. When H0 is true and the errors i have a normal distribution, the F-statistic follows an F-distribution.6 For any given value of n and p, any statistical software package can be used to compute the p-value associated with the F-statistic using this distribution. Based on this p-value, we can determine whether or not to reject H0. For the advertising data, the p-value associated with the F-statistic in Table 3.6 is essentially zero, so we have extremely strong evidence that at least one of the media is associated with increased sales. In (3.23) we are testing H0 that all the coefficients are zero. Sometimes we want to test that a particular subset of q of the coefficients are zero. This corresponds to a null hypothesis
H0 : βp−q+1 = βp−q+2 = . . . = βp = 0,
6Even if the errors are not normally-distributed, the F-statistic approximately follows an F-distribution provided that the sample size n is large.


3.2 Multiple Linear Regression 77
where for convenience we have put the variables chosen for omission at the end of the list. In this case we fit a second model that uses all the variables except those last q. Suppose that the residual sum of squares for that model is RSS0. Then the appropriate F-statistic is
F = (RSS0 − RSS)/q
RSS/(n − p − 1) . (3.24)
Notice that in Table 3.4, for each individual predictor a t-statistic and a p-value were reported. These provide information about whether each individual predictor is related to the response, after adjusting for the other predictors. It turns out that each of these are exactly equivalent7 to the F-test that omits that single variable from the model, leaving all the others in—i.e. q=1 in (3.24). So it reports the partial effect of adding that variable to the model. For instance, as we discussed earlier, these p-values indicate that TV and radio are related to sales, but that there is no evidence that newspaper is associated with sales, in the presence of these two. Given these individual p-values for each variable, why do we need to look at the overall F-statistic? After all, it seems likely that if any one of the p-values for the individual variables is very small, then at least one of the predictors is related to the response. However, this logic is flawed, especially when the number of predictors p is large. For instance, consider an example in which p = 100 and H0 : β1 = β2 = . . . = βp = 0 is true, so no variable is truly associated with the response. In this situation, about 5 % of the p-values associated with each variable (of the type shown in Table 3.4) will be below 0.05 by chance. In other words, we expect to see approximately five small p-values even in the absence of any true association between the predictors and the response. In fact, we are almost guaranteed that we will observe at least one p-value below 0.05 by chance! Hence, if we use the individual t-statistics and associated pvalues in order to decide whether or not there is any association between the variables and the response, there is a very high chance that we will incorrectly conclude that there is a relationship. However, the F-statistic does not suffer from this problem because it adjusts for the number of predictors. Hence, if H0 is true, there is only a 5 % chance that the Fstatistic will result in a p-value below 0.05, regardless of the number of predictors or the number of observations. The approach of using an F-statistic to test for any association between the predictors and the response works when p is relatively small, and certainly small compared to n. However, sometimes we have a very large number of variables. If p > n then there are more coefficients βj to estimate than observations from which to estimate them. In this case we cannot even fit the multiple linear regression model using least squares, so the
7The square of each t-statistic is the corresponding F-statistic.


78 3. Linear Regression
F-statistic cannot be used, and neither can most of the other concepts that we have seen so far in this chapter. When p is large, some of the approaches discussed in the next section, such as forward selection, can be used. This high-dimensional setting is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6. high
dimensional
Two: Deciding on Important Variables
As discussed in the previous section, the first step in a multiple regression analysis is to compute the F-statistic and to examine the associated pvalue. If we conclude on the basis of that p-value that at least one of the predictors is related to the response, then it is natural to wonder which are the guilty ones! We could look at the individual p-values as in Table 3.4, but as discussed, if p is large we are likely to make some false discoveries. It is possible that all of the predictors are associated with the response, but it is more often the case that the response is only related to a subset of the predictors. The task of determining which predictors are associated with the response, in order to fit a single model involving only those predictors, is referred to as variable selection. The variable selection problem is studied variable
selection
extensively in Chapter 6, and so here we will provide only a brief outline of some classical approaches. Ideally, we would like to perform variable selection by trying out a lot of different models, each containing a different subset of the predictors. For instance, if p = 2, then we can consider four models: (1) a model containing no variables, (2) a model containing X1 only, (3) a model containing X2 only, and (4) a model containing both X1 and X2. We can then select the best model out of all of the models that we have considered. How do we determine which model is best? Various statistics can be used to judge the quality of a model. These include Mallow’s Cp, Akaike informa- Mallow’s Cp
tion criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and adjusted Akaike
information criterion Bayesian information criterion
R2. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6. We can also deter
adjusted R2
mine which model is best by plotting various model outputs, such as the residuals, in order to search for patterns. Unfortunately, there are a total of 2p models that contain subsets of p variables. This means that even for moderate p, trying out every possible subset of the predictors is infeasible. For instance, we saw that if p = 2, then there are 22 = 4 models to consider. But if p = 30, then we must consider 230 = 1,073,741,824 models! This is not practical. Therefore, unless p is very small, we cannot consider all 2p models, and instead we need an automated and efficient approach to choose a smaller set of models to consider. There are three classical approaches for this task:
• Forward selection. We begin with the null model—a model that con- forward
selection null model
tains an intercept but no predictors. We then fit p simple linear regressions and add to the null model the variable that results in the lowest RSS. We then add to that model the variable that results


3.2 Multiple Linear Regression 79
in the lowest RSS for the new two-variable model. This approach is continued until some stopping rule is satisfied.
• Backward selection. We start with all variables in the model, and backward
selection
remove the variable with the largest p-value—that is, the variable that is the least statistically significant. The new (p − 1)-variable model is fit, and the variable with the largest p-value is removed. This procedure continues until a stopping rule is reached. For instance, we may stop when all remaining variables have a p-value below some threshold.
• Mixed selection. This is a combination of forward and backward se- mixed
selection
lection. We start with no variables in the model, and as with forward selection, we add the variable that provides the best fit. We continue to add variables one-by-one. Of course, as we noted with the Advertising example, the p-values for variables can become larger as new predictors are added to the model. Hence, if at any point the p-value for one of the variables in the model rises above a certain threshold, then we remove that variable from the model. We continue to perform these forward and backward steps until all variables in the model have a sufficiently low p-value, and all variables outside the model would have a large p-value if added to the model.
Backward selection cannot be used if p > n, while forward selection can always be used. Forward selection is a greedy approach, and might include variables early that later become redundant. Mixed selection can remedy this.
Three: Model Fit
Two of the most common numerical measures of model fit are the RSE and R2, the fraction of variance explained. These quantities are computed and interpreted in the same fashion as for simple linear regression. Recall that in simple regression, R2 is the square of the correlation of the response and the variable. In multiple linear regression, it turns out that it equals Cor(Y, Yˆ )2, the square of the correlation between the response and the fitted linear model; in fact one property of the fitted linear model is that it maximizes this correlation among all possible linear models. An R2 value close to 1 indicates that the model explains a large portion of the variance in the response variable. As an example, we saw in Table 3.6 that for the Advertising data, the model that uses all three advertising media to predict sales has an R2 of 0.8972. On the other hand, the model that uses only TV and radio to predict sales has an R2 value of 0.89719. In other words, there is a small increase in R2 if we include newspaper advertising in the model that already contains TV and radio advertising, even though we saw earlier that the p-value for newspaper advertising in Table 3.4 is not significant. It turns out that R2 will always increase when more variables


80 3. Linear Regression
are added to the model, even if those variables are only weakly associated with the response. This is due to the fact that adding another variable to the least squares equations must allow us to fit the training data (though not necessarily the testing data) more accurately. Thus, the R2 statistic, which is also computed on the training data, must increase. The fact that adding newspaper advertising to the model containing only TV and radio advertising leads to just a tiny increase in R2 provides additional evidence that newspaper can be dropped from the model. Essentially, newspaper provides no real improvement in the model fit to the training samples, and its inclusion will likely lead to poor results on independent test samples due to overfitting. In contrast, the model containing only TV as a predictor had an R2 of 0.61 (Table 3.2). Adding radio to the model leads to a substantial improvement in R2. This implies that a model that uses TV and radio expenditures to predict sales is substantially better than one that uses only TV advertising. We could further quantify this improvement by looking at the p-value for the radio coefficient in a model that contains only TV and radio as predictors. The model that contains only TV and radio as predictors has an RSE of 1.681, and the model that also contains newspaper as a predictor has an RSE of 1.686 (Table 3.6). In contrast, the model that contains only TV has an RSE of 3.26 (Table 3.2). This corroborates our previous conclusion that a model that uses TV and radio expenditures to predict sales is much more accurate (on the training data) than one that only uses TV spending. Furthermore, given that TV and radio expenditures are used as predictors, there is no point in also using newspaper spending as a predictor in the model. The observant reader may wonder how RSE can increase when newspaper is added to the model given that RSS must decrease. In general RSE is defined as
RSE =
√1
n − p − 1 RSS, (3.25)
which simplifies to (3.15) for a simple linear regression. Thus, models with more variables can have higher RSE if the decrease in RSS is small relative to the increase in p. In addition to looking at the RSE and R2 statistics just discussed, it can be useful to plot the data. Graphical summaries can reveal problems with a model that are not visible from numerical statistics. For example, Figure 3.5 displays a three-dimensional plot of TV and radio versus sales. We see that some observations lie above and some observations lie below the least squares regression plane. In particular, the linear model seems to overestimate sales for instances in which most of the advertising money was spent exclusively on either TV or radio. It underestimates sales for instances where the budget was split between the two media. This pronounced non-linear pattern cannot be modeled accurately using linear re

FIGURE 3.5. For the Advertising data, a linear regression fit to sales using TV and radio as predictors. From the pattern of the residuals, we can see that there is a pronounced non-linear relationship in the data. The positive residuals (those visible above the surface), tend to lie along the 45-degree line, where TV and Radio budgets are split evenly. The negative residuals (most not visible), tend to lie away from this line, where budgets are more lopsided.
gression. It suggests a synergy or interaction effect between the advertising media, whereby combining the media together results in a bigger boost to sales than using any single medium. In Section 3.3.2, we will discuss extending the linear model to accommodate such synergistic effects through the use of interaction terms.
Four: Predictions
Once we have fit the multiple regression model, it is straightforward to apply (3.21) in order to predict the response Y on the basis of a set of values for the predictors X1, X2, . . . , Xp. However, there are three sorts of uncertainty associated with this prediction.
1. The coefficient estimates βˆ0, βˆ1, . . . , βˆp are estimates for β0, β1, . . . , βp. That is, the least squares plane
Yˆ = βˆ0 + βˆ1X1 + · · · + βˆpXp
is only an estimate for the true population regression plane
f (X) = β0 + β1X1 + · · · + βpXp.
The inaccuracy in the coefficient estimates is related to the reducible error from Chapter 2. We can compute a confidence interval in order to determine how close Yˆ will be to f (X).


82 3. Linear Regression
2. Of course, in practice assuming a linear model for f (X) is almost always an approximation of reality, so there is an additional source of potentially reducible error which we call model bias. So when we use a linear model, we are in fact estimating the best linear approximation to the true surface. However, here we will ignore this discrepancy, and operate as if the linear model were correct.
3. Even if we knew f (X)—that is, even if we knew the true values for β0, β1, . . . , βp—the response value cannot be predicted perfectly because of the random error in the model (3.21). In Chapter 2, we referred to this as the irreducible error. How much will Y vary from Yˆ ? We use prediction intervals to answer this question. Prediction intervals are always wider than confidence intervals, because they incorporate both the error in the estimate for f (X) (the reducible error) and the uncertainty as to how much an individual point will differ from the population regression plane (the irreducible error).
We use a confidence interval to quantify the uncertainty surrounding confidence
interval
the average sales over a large number of cities. For example, given that $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 is spent on radio advertising in each city, the 95 % confidence interval is [10,985, 11,528]. We interpret this to mean that 95 % of intervals of this form will contain the true value of f (X).8 On the other hand, a prediction interval can be used to quantify the prediction
interval
uncertainty surrounding sales for a particular city. Given that $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 is spent on radio advertising in that city the 95 % prediction interval is [7,930, 14,580]. We interpret this to mean that 95 % of intervals of this form will contain the true value of Y for this city. Note that both intervals are centered at 11,256, but that the prediction interval is substantially wider than the confidence interval, reflecting the increased uncertainty about sales for a given city in comparison to the average sales over many locations.
3.3 Other Considerations in the Regression Model
3.3.1 Qualitative Predictors
In our discussion so far, we have assumed that all variables in our linear regression model are quantitative. But in practice, this is not necessarily the case; often some predictors are qualitative.
8In other words, if we collect a large number of data sets like the Advertising data set, and we construct a confidence interval for the average sales on the basis of each data set (given $100,000 in TV and $20,000 in radio advertising), then 95 % of these confidence intervals will contain the true value of average sales.


3.3 Other Considerations in the Regression Model 83
For example, the Credit data set displayed in Figure 3.6 records balance (average credit card debt for a number of individuals) as well as several quantitative predictors: age, cards (number of credit cards), education (years of education), income (in thousands of dollars), limit (credit limit), and rating (credit rating). Each panel of Figure 3.6 is a scatterplot for a pair of variables whose identities are given by the corresponding row and column labels. For example, the scatterplot directly to the right of the word “Balance” depicts balance versus age, while the plot directly to the right of “Age” corresponds to age versus cards. In addition to these quantitative variables, we also have four qualitative variables: gender, student (student status), status (marital status), and ethnicity (Caucasian, African American or Asian).

Predictors with Only Two Levels
Suppose that we wish to investigate differences in credit card balance between males and females, ignoring the other variables for the moment. If a qualitative predictor (also known as a factor) only has two levels, or possi- factor
level
ble values, then incorporating it into a regression model is very simple. We simply create an indicator or dummy variable that takes on two possible dummy
variable
numerical values. For example, based on the gender variable, we can create a new variable that takes the form
xi =
{
1 if ith person is female
0 if ith person is male, (3.26)
and use this variable as a predictor in the regression equation. This results in the model
yi = β0 + β1xi + i =
{
β0 + β1 + i if ith person is female
β0 + i if ith person is male. (3.27)
Now β0 can be interpreted as the average credit card balance among males, β0 + β1 as the average credit card balance among females, and β1 as the average difference in credit card balance between females and males. Table 3.7 displays the coefficient estimates and other information associated with the model (3.27). The average credit card debt for males is estimated to be $509.80, whereas females are estimated to carry $19.73 in additional debt for a total of $509.80 + $19.73 = $529.53. However, we notice that the p-value for the dummy variable is very high. This indicates that there is no statistical evidence of a difference in average credit card balance between the genders. The decision to code females as 1 and males as 0 in (3.27) is arbitrary, and has no effect on the regression fit, but does alter the interpretation of the coefficients. If we had coded males as 1 and females as 0, then the estimates for β0 and β1 would have been 529.53 and −19.73, respectively, leading once again to a prediction of credit card debt of $529.53 − $19.73 = $509.80 for males and a prediction of $529.53 for females. Alternatively, instead of a 0/1 coding scheme, we could create a dummy variable


3.3 Other Considerations in the Regression Model 85
xi =
{
1 if ith person is female
−1 if ith person is male
and use this variable in the regression equation. This results in the model
yi = β0 + β1xi + i =
{
β0 + β1 + i if ith person is female
β0 − β1 + i if ith person is male.
Now β0 can be interpreted as the overall average credit card balance (ignoring the gender effect), and β1 is the amount that females are above the average and males are below the average. In this example, the estimate for β0 would be $519.665, halfway between the male and female averages of $509.80 and $529.53. The estimate for β1 would be $9.865, which is half of $19.73, the average difference between females and males. It is important to note that the final predictions for the credit balances of males and females will be identical regardless of the coding scheme used. The only difference is in the way that the coefficients are interpreted.
Qualitative Predictors with More than Two Levels
When a qualitative predictor has more than two levels, a single dummy variable cannot represent all possible values. In this situation, we can create additional dummy variables. For example, for the ethnicity variable we create two dummy variables. The first could be
xi1 =
{
1 if ith person is Asian
0 if ith person is not Asian, (3.28)
and the second could be
xi2 =
{
1 if ith person is Caucasian
0 if ith person is not Caucasian. (3.29)
Then both of these variables can be used in the regression equation, in order to obtain the model
yi = β0+β1xi1+β2xi2+ i =
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
β0+β1+ i if ith person is Asian
β0+β2+ i if ith person is Caucasian
β0+ i if ith person is African American. (3.30) Now β0 can be interpreted as the average credit card balance for African Americans, β1 can be interpreted as the difference in the average balance between the Asian and African American categories, and β2 can be interpreted as the difference in the average balance between the Caucasian and

African American categories. There will always be one fewer dummy variable than the number of levels. The level with no dummy variable—African American in this example—is known as the baseline. baseline
From Table 3.8, we see that the estimated balance for the baseline, African American, is $531.00. It is estimated that the Asian category will have $18.69 less debt than the African American category, and that the Caucasian category will have $12.50 less debt than the African American category. However, the p-values associated with the coefficient estimates for the two dummy variables are very large, suggesting no statistical evidence of a real difference in credit card balance between the ethnicities. Once again, the level selected as the baseline category is arbitrary, and the final predictions for each group will be the same regardless of this choice. However, the coefficients and their p-values do depend on the choice of dummy variable coding. Rather than rely on the individual coefficients, we can use an F-test to test H0 : β1 = β2 = 0; this does not depend on the coding. This F-test has a p-value of 0.96, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between balance and ethnicity. Using this dummy variable approach presents no difficulties when incorporating both quantitative and qualitative predictors. For example, to regress balance on both a quantitative variable such as income and a qualitative variable such as student, we must simply create a dummy variable for student and then fit a multiple regression model using income and the dummy variable as predictors for credit card balance. There are many different ways of coding qualitative variables besides the dummy variable approach taken here. All of these approaches lead to equivalent model fits, but the coefficients are different and have different interpretations, and are designed to measure particular contrasts. This topic contrast
is beyond the scope of the book, and so we will not pursue it further.
3.3.2 Extensions of the Linear Model
The standard linear regression model (3.19) provides interpretable results and works quite well on many real-world problems. However, it makes several highly restrictive assumptions that are often violated in practice. Two of the most important assumptions state that the relationship between the predictors and response are additive and linear. The additive assumption additive
linear


3.3 Other Considerations in the Regression Model 87
means that the effect of changes in a predictor Xj on the response Y is independent of the values of the other predictors. The linear assumption states that the change in the response Y due to a one-unit change in Xj is constant, regardless of the value of Xj. In this book, we examine a number of sophisticated methods that relax these two assumptions. Here, we briefly examine some common classical approaches for extending the linear model.
Removing the Additive Assumption
In our previous analysis of the Advertising data, we concluded that both TV and radio seem to be associated with sales. The linear models that formed the basis for this conclusion assumed that the effect on sales of increasing one advertising medium is independent of the amount spent on the other media. For example, the linear model (3.20) states that the average effect on sales of a one-unit increase in TV is always β1, regardless of the amount spent on radio. However, this simple model may be incorrect. Suppose that spending money on radio advertising actually increases the effectiveness of TV advertising, so that the slope term for TV should increase as radio increases. In this situation, given a fixed budget of $100,000, spending half on radio and half on TV may increase sales more than allocating the entire amount to either TV or to radio. In marketing, this is known as a synergy effect, and in statistics it is referred to as an interaction effect. Figure 3.5 suggests that such an effect may be present in the advertising data. Notice that when levels of either TV or radio are low, then the true sales are lower than predicted by the linear model. But when advertising is split between the two media, then the model tends to underestimate sales. Consider the standard linear regression model with two variables,
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + .
According to this model, if we increase X1 by one unit, then Y will increase by an average of β1 units. Notice that the presence of X2 does not alter this statement—that is, regardless of the value of X2, a one-unit increase in X1 will lead to a β1-unit increase in Y . One way of extending this model to allow for interaction effects is to include a third predictor, called an interaction term, which is constructed by computing the product of X1 and X2. This results in the model
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X1X2 + . (3.31)
How does inclusion of this interaction term relax the additive assumption? Notice that (3.31) can be rewritten as
Y = β0 + (β1 + β3X2)X1 + β2X2 + (3.32)
= β0 + β ̃1X1 + β2X2 +

where β ̃1 = β1 + β3X2. Since β ̃1 changes with X2, the effect of X1 on Y is no longer constant: adjusting X2 will change the impact of X1 on Y . For example, suppose that we are interested in studying the productivity of a factory. We wish to predict the number of units produced on the basis of the number of production lines and the total number of workers. It seems likely that the effect of increasing the number of production lines will depend on the number of workers, since if no workers are available to operate the lines, then increasing the number of lines will not increase production. This suggests that it would be appropriate to include an interaction term between lines and workers in a linear model to predict units. Suppose that when we fit the model, we obtain
units ≈ 1.2 + 3.4 × lines + 0.22 × workers + 1.4 × (lines × workers)
= 1.2 + (3.4 + 1.4 × workers) × lines + 0.22 × workers.
In other words, adding an additional line will increase the number of units produced by 3.4 + 1.4 × workers. Hence the more workers we have, the stronger will be the effect of lines. We now return to the Advertising example. A linear model that uses radio, TV, and an interaction between the two to predict sales takes the form
sales = β0 + β1 × TV + β2 × radio + β3 × (radio × TV) +
= β0 + (β1 + β3 × radio) × TV + β2 × radio + . (3.33)
We can interpret β3 as the increase in the effectiveness of TV advertising for a one unit increase in radio advertising (or vice-versa). The coefficients that result from fitting the model (3.33) are given in Table 3.9. The results in Table 3.9 strongly suggest that the model that includes the interaction term is superior to the model that contains only main effects. main effect
The p-value for the interaction term, TV×radio, is extremely low, indicating that there is strong evidence for Ha : β3 = 0. In other words, it is clear that the true relationship is not additive. The R2 for the model (3.33) is 96.8 %, compared to only 89.7 % for the model that predicts sales using TV and radio without an interaction term. This means that (96.8 − 89.7)/(100 − 89.7) = 69 % of the variability in sales that remains after fitting the additive model has been explained by the interaction term. The coefficient
