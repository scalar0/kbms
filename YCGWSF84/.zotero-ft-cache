Example: German Energiewende
• Decisions mainly drawn from a techno-economic scenario analysis (Dieckhoff et al., 2016)
Conclusions:
• Limitations of used approaches have been pointed out (Dieckhoff et al., 2016; Schmid et al., 2016; Fischer et al. 2016) • No multi-dimensional view taken into account → Stakeholder dependencies etc. • Technology treated as „building blocks“ → No latencies for deployment taken into account

How can we design transitions of large-scale systems „better“?


Designing Transitions and Interventions
In large-scale systems, usually nothing is designed from „scratch“ → Rather changes to existing systems → Called „transitions“ or „interventions“ to indicate that we are transforming something existing.
Objective: Survey existing approaches for designing transitions and interventions

Emerging Approaches
1) Technology transitions focus on describing transitions as an interaction between multiple layers, namely, the technological niche, socio-technical regime, and landscape development 2) Transition design (co-creation of interventions with stakeholders; Focus on radical transitions for wicked problems; soft approach), 3) DesignX (design and implementation of interventions; Favors incrementalism and satisficing), 4) Engineering systems design (application of systems engineering and operations research approaches), 5) Systems of systems engineering (linking technical systems with collaborations between actors, governance).

Technology transitions
Geels, F. W. (2002). Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case-study. Research policy, 31(8-9), 1257-1274.
• Transdisciplinary foundations: Merges concepts from evolutionary economics, sociotechnical studies, structuration theory, and neo-institutional theory • More of a descriptive approach rather than for designing transitions as such
Grin, J., Rotmans, J., & Schot, J. (2010). Transitions to sustainable development: new directions in the study of long term transformative change. Routledge.
Operationalization for use as a design method would be needed


Transition design
• Qualitative, co-creation of interventions with stakeholders; • Focus on radical transitions for wicked problems; • Soft approach

Flexible framework combining different methods with a relatively narrow forus (radical transitions of wicked problems)


DesignX
Norman, D. A., & Stappers, P. J. (2015). DesignX: complex sociotechnical
systems. She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation, 1(2), 83106.
“DesignX is a new, evidence-based approach for
addressing many of the complex and serious
problems facing the world today.”
• Emphasis on validated methods, frameworks,
patterns, heuristics (evidence-based design)
• Incrementalism and opportunistic acting
(“muddling through”): large uncertainties,
unknowns
• Satisficing (sufficiently good) rather than
optimizing

sociotechnical systems. In Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers (pp. 988-991).
Seems rather like a manifesto / research
program rather than an operational method

• Legacy: systems engineering, systems architecting (flexibility), program management, socio-technical systems
• Fragmented method landscape: Only common point is engineering systems • Future research directions (Maier et al., 2022): Managing system requirements at societal scale, designing, scale-covariant systems, and making connectability a core systems capability
Engineering design researchers looking at larger-scale problems


Systems of systems engineering
What is a system of systems (SoS)? „collaboratively integrated systems“:
• Operational independence of the
components: „the components fulfill customer-operator purposes on their own.”
• Managerial independence of the
components: „The component systems are separately acquired and integrated but maintain a continuing operational existence independent of the system-ofsystems.“

Conclusions
• Several emerging approaches for large-scale systems design exist • Most have a rather restricted conceptual foundation (technology transitions is an exception) • Potential to develop an open, integrative framework for large-scale systems design
